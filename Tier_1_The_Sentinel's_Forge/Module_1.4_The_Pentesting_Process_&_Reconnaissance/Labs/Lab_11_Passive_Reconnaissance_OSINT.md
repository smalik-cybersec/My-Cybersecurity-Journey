# üß™ Lab 11: Passive Reconnaissance (OSINT)

### Date: 2025-07-24
### Mentor: *The Da Vinci Cypher*
### Protocol Tier: Tier 1 ‚Äî The Sentinel's Forge
### Module: Module 1.4 ‚Äî The Pentesting Process & Reconnaissance

## üéØ 1. Objective
To perform passive reconnaissance (OSINT) on an authorized target domain (`nmap.org`) using publicly available web-based tools. The goal is to gather intelligence about domain ownership and hosting infrastructure without sending any direct, detectable probes to the target's systems.

## üß∞ 2. Tools Used
| Tool/Website | Purpose |
|--------------|---------|
| `CentralOps.net` | A web-based suite of network tools used for an initial WHOIS lookup. |
| `ViewDNS.info` | A web-based suite of DNS and IP tools, used here to find historical IP and ownership data. |

## üñ•Ô∏è 3. Process & Findings

### üîπ Step 1: Initial WHOIS Lookup on `scanme.nmap.org`

*   An initial WHOIS lookup on the subdomain revealed a **WHOIS privacy service** ("Super Privacy Service LTD c/o Dynadot").
*   **Intelligence:** This indicates that the domain owner has intentionally obscured their identity, a common practice. This is a minor roadblock for an attacker, preventing the immediate discovery of contact details.

### üîπ Step 2: Pivoting to IP History on the Top-Level Domain

*   Recognizing the limitations of some tools with subdomains, the investigation pivoted to the top-level domain, `nmap.org`.
*   An **IP History** lookup was performed using `ViewDNS.info`.
*   **Output Snippet:**
  ```plaintext
  IP Address  Location  IP Address Owner  Last Seen On This IP
  50.116.1.184  Fremont - US  Akamai Connected Cloud  2025-07-24
  ```

## üîé 4. Observations & Analysis

* The key finding from the reconnaissance process was that the `nmap.org` domain is hosted on infrastructure owned by **Akamai Connected Cloud**.
* Akamai is a major Content Delivery Network (CDN) and cloud security provider.
* **Security Insight:** This is a critical piece of strategic intelligence. It informs the attacker that the target is not a simple, standalone server. It is protected by a sophisticated, globally distributed network that likely includes powerful defenses such as:
  * **DDoS Mitigation:** Resistance to large-scale traffic floods.
  * **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** Filtering of common web-based attacks.
  * **IP Obfuscation:** The true IP address of the origin server is hidden behind Akamai's proxy network.

## ‚úÖ 5. Conclusion

This lab demonstrated a realistic passive reconnaissance workflow. We encountered a common obstacle (WHOIS privacy) and successfully pivoted our strategy to uncover valuable intelligence. The discovery that the target is behind a major security provider like Akamai fundamentally changes the approach an attacker must take. It forces them away from simple network-level attacks and towards more advanced techniques like social engineering or exploiting application-level logic flaws that may bypass the WAF. This lab highlights that the goal of reconnaissance is not just to collect data, but to build a strategic understanding of the target's defensive posture.
