# üß™ Lab 12: Advanced Reconnaissance with Nmap NSE

### Date: 2025-07-25
### Mentor: *The Da Vinci Cypher*
### Protocol Tier: Tier 1 ‚Äî The Sentinel's Forge
### Module: Module 1.5 ‚Äî Active Reconnaissance & Vulnerability Scanning

## üéØ 1. Objective
To perform an advanced active reconnaissance scan using `nmap`. The goal is to go beyond simple port discovery and utilize `nmap`'s capabilities for Service/Version Detection (`-sV`) and the Nmap Scripting Engine (`-sC`) to gather detailed, actionable intelligence about the services running on a target.

## üß∞ 2. Tools Used
| Tool/Command | Purpose |
|--------------|---------|
| `nmap -sV -sC` | Performs a TCP SYN scan that also identifies service versions and runs default NSE scripts. |

## üñ•Ô∏è 3. Process & Commands (Live Data Capture)

* **Command:** `sudo nmap -sV -sC scanme.nmap.org`
* **Output:**
  ```plaintext
  Nmap scan report for scanme.nmap.org (45.33.32.156)
  Host is up (0.024s latency).
  Not shown: 998 filtered tcp ports (no-response)
  PORT   STATE SERVICE VERSION

## üîé 4. Observations & Analysis

* The scan successfully identified two open ports: 22/tcp and 80/tcp.
* **Port 22 (SSH):** Service detection (`-sV`) identified the specific version as **OpenSSH 6.6.1p1**. The NSE script (`-sC`) successfully enumerated the server's public host keys.
* **Port 80 (HTTP):** Service detection identified the web server as **Apache httpd 2.4.7**. The NSE scripts provided additional context, such as the page title ("Go ahead and ScanMe!").
* **Security Insight:** The key intelligence gathered is the specific version numbers of the running services. Both OpenSSH 6.6.1p1 and Apache 2.4.7 are significantly outdated pieces of software (circa 2013-2014). For a real-world target, this would be a critical finding, as outdated software is highly likely to contain numerous publicly known vulnerabilities (CVEs) for which exploits are readily available.

## ‚úÖ 5. Conclusion

This lab demonstrated the power of advanced `nmap` scanning in the active reconnaissance phase of a penetration test. By moving beyond simple port scanning to include service/version detection and script scanning, we transformed generic findings into highly actionable intelligence. The discovery of outdated software versions provides a penetration tester with a clear and immediate path for the next phase of the engagement: researching these specific versions for known exploits. This process is fundamental to modern vulnerability assessment and ethical hacking.
