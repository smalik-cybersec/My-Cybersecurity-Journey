## 1. Key Definitions

- **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol):** A connection-oriented, reliable transport layer (Layer 4) protocol. It ensures all data packets arrive in the correct order without errors. It establishes a connection using a **Three-Way Handshake (SYN, SYN/ACK, ACK)**.
- **UDP (User Datagram Protocol):** A connectionless, unreliable transport layer (Layer 4) protocol. It prioritizes speed over accuracy, sending data as "datagrams" with no guarantee of delivery or order.
- **Port Number:** A 16-bit number (0-65535) used to identify a specific process or service on a machine. It allows a single IP address to host multiple services. Analogous to an apartment number in a building.
- **Port Scanning:** The process of probing a server or host for open ports. This is a fundamental reconnaissance technique used to discover running services and potential attack vectors.
- **Nmap (Network Mapper):** The industry-standard tool for network discovery and security auditing. It is used to perform port scans, service detection, and OS fingerprinting.

## 2. Core Concepts & Analogies

- **TCP is the "Reliable Courier Service":** Like sending a legal document via FedEx. A connection is established, every package is tracked (numbered), and delivery is guaranteed. Use cases: Web (HTTP/S), Email (SMTP), File Transfer (FTP).
- **UDP is the "Fast Postcard":** Like dropping a postcard in a mailbox. It's fast and requires no prior setup, but there's no guarantee of delivery. Use cases: Live Streaming (Video/Audio), Online Gaming, DNS.
- **IP Address vs. Port:** The IP address gets you to the correct **building**. The Port Number gets you to the correct **apartment** (application) inside that building.

## 3. Cybersecurity Relevance

Understanding Layer 4 protocols and scanning is critical for both offense and defense.

- **Attacker's Perspective (Red Team):**

  - **Reconnaissance:** Port scanning with `nmap` is often the very first active step in an engagement. The goal is to map the target's "attack surface."
  - **Vulnerability Identification:** An open port indicates a running service. The attacker will then try to identify the specific version of that service (e.g., Apache 2.4.41) to search for known exploits.
  - **Stealth:** Attackers use specific scan types (like the `-sS` SYN scan) to be less "noisy" and avoid detection by simple Intrusion Detection Systems.

- **Defender's Perspective (Blue Team):**
  - **System Hardening:** The goal is to minimize the attack surface. A defender will use a firewall to close all ports that are not absolutely essential for the system's function.
  - **Auditing & Baselining:** Defenders run regular `nmap` scans on their own networks to ensure no unauthorized services have been started and that firewall rules are working as expected. An unexpected open port is a high-priority alert.
  - **Threat Hunting:** Seeing a large volume of `nmap` scan traffic from an unknown IP address in firewall logs is a clear indicator that the network is being targeted.

## 4. Personal Reflections & Questions

_(This space is for your own thoughts. Here are some examples to guide you.)_

- _Key Takeaway:_ The ambiguity of a UDP scan (`open|filtered`) is not a failure of the tool, but a piece of information in itself, strongly implying the presence of a firewall.
- _Personal Analogy:_ TCP is like a registered phone call where both parties say "hello" before talking. UDP is like shouting a message across a crowded room and hoping the right person hears it.
- _Further Question:_ "If a port is open, how can an attacker find out the exact version of the software running on it?" (This foreshadows `nmap`'s service version detection capabilities, e.g., using the `-sV` flag).
