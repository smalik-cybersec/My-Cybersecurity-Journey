## üß† What Makes a Computer Work?

At its heart, a computer is a system of **three main components** working in concert:

| Component | Role | Volatility | Speed | Real-World Term |
|-----------|------|------------|-------|------------------|
| **CPU** (Central Processing Unit) | Executes instructions | N/A | ‚ö° Very Fast | üß† Brain |
| **RAM** (Random Access Memory) | Temporary workspace for active data | üü† Volatile | ‚ö°‚ö° Fast | üßæ Countertop |
| **Storage** (HDD/SSD) | Long-term data retention | üü¢ Non-volatile | üê¢ Slower | üìö Pantry |

## üë®‚Äçüç≥ Real-World Analogy: The Chef‚Äôs Kitchen

> To understand how these components interact, imagine a **chef preparing a meal** in a kitchen:

| Element | Analogy |
|--------|---------|
| **CPU** | üë®‚Äçüç≥ The Chef ‚Äî Performs the actions (cooking, chopping) |
| **RAM** | üßæ The Countertop ‚Äî A small, fast-access workspace |
| **Storage** | üìö The Pantry ‚Äî Holds many recipe books (files), but retrieval is slow |

### üç≥ Step-by-Step

1. The **chef (CPU)** retrieves a **recipe book (program data)** from the **pantry (Storage)**.
2. He places the recipe on the **countertop (RAM)** to read from it quickly.
3. While cooking, the **chef only works from the countertop** ‚Äî not from the pantry.
4. If the power goes out, the **countertop is wiped clean**, but the **pantry retains all recipe books**.

## üõ°Ô∏è Cybersecurity Relevance

> Understanding these components is crucial for both offense and defense in cybersecurity.

### üî∫ Why Attackers Care About RAM

- **Sensitive data** (passwords, session keys, decrypted files) lives in **RAM temporarily** while programs run.
- RAM is a **target for memory scraping**, live forensics, or **cold boot attacks**.
  
### üîì Common RAM-Based Attacks

| Attack Type | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| **Buffer Overflow** | Overwrites memory areas by exceeding allocated RAM space ‚Äî can hijack execution. |
| **RAM Dumping** | Attackers extract sensitive credentials from active memory (e.g., using `mimikatz` or `volatility`). |
| **Fileless Malware** | Runs purely in RAM without touching disk ‚Äî harder to detect and forensically trace. |

## üß™ Knowledge Check

> üí¨ **Mentor Asks:**  
> Shahid, based on our kitchen analogy:

> **‚ùì If a piece of malware wants to ensure it runs *every time the computer starts*, would it be more effective for it to hide in the pantry (Storage) or on the countertop (RAM)? Why?**
