### Date: 2025-07-26

### Mentor: *The Da Vinci Cypher*

### Protocol Tier: Tier 2 — The Cipher's Labyrinth (Blue Path)

### Module: Module 2.4 — Malware Analysis & Reverse Engineering

## 🎯 1. Objective

To perform the most fundamental step of static malware analysis: generating a file hash and checking its reputation against a public threat intelligence database (VirusTotal).

## 🧰 2. Tools Used

| Tool/Command | Purpose |
|--------------|---------|
| `echo`       | Used to create the simulated malware sample (EICAR test file). |
| `md5sum`     | A command-line utility to compute the MD5 hash of a file. |
| `VirusTotal` | A public, web-based platform that aggregates the results of over 70 antivirus engines and other security tools. |

## 🖥️ 3. Process & Findings

### 🔹 Step 1: Generating the File Hash (The IOC)

* The EICAR standard antivirus test file was created on the Kali Linux VM.
* **Command:** `md5sum eicar.com`
* **Output (The Indicator of Compromise):**

    ```plaintext
    69630e4574ec6798239b091cda43dca0  eicar.com
    ```

### 🔹 Step 2: Checking the Hash Reputation

* The MD5 hash `69630e4574ec6798239b091cda43dca0` was submitted to the search function on VirusTotal.
* **Finding:** VirusTotal returned a high-confidence detection score (e.g., 60/68), indicating that the vast majority of security vendors in the world recognize this hash as malicious.

## 🔎 4. Observations & Analysis

* This two-step process—**hash, then search**—is the cornerstone of efficient malware triage.
* It allows an analyst to rapidly determine if an unknown file is a well-known, previously analyzed threat without ever having to execute the file.
* **Security Insight:** In a real incident, a high detection score like this is a critical piece of intelligence. It confirms that the file is malicious. The analyst can then pivot to the "Details" and "Behavior" tabs in VirusTotal (which we did not explore in this lab) to see what other analysts have discovered about the malware's capabilities, its network connections (C2 servers), and what filenames it is commonly associated with. This saves the analyst from having to perform a full dynamic analysis from scratch.

## ✅ 5. Conclusion

This lab demonstrated the first and most critical workflow in static malware analysis. By hashing a file and querying a threat intelligence aggregator like VirusTotal, we can instantly leverage the collective knowledge of the entire global security community. This process is fundamental to any defensive role, from a SOC analyst investigating a suspicious file alert to an incident responder triaging a potentially compromised host. It is the fastest and safest way to move from "unknown" to "known-bad."
