## 📘 Introduction

When transferring files across systems—especially over a public or untrusted network—it’s vital to **encrypt** the communication to protect data integrity, confidentiality, and authenticity.

Linux offers powerful, secure tools that leverage **SSH (Secure Shell)** to securely transfer files.

---

## 🔒 Why Secure Transfer Matters

| Risk Without Encryption          | Secure Transfer Solution  |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Password leakage                 | Encrypted SSH sessions    |
| File tampering                   | End-to-end authentication |
| MITM (Man-in-the-Middle) attacks | Encrypted channels        |
| Forensic evidence compromise     | `scp` or `rsync` over SSH |

---

## 🧰 Tools for Secure File Transfer

| Tool           | Description                                |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `scp`          | Simple, secure file copy over SSH          |
| `rsync -e ssh` | Fast, resumable, incremental sync          |
| `sftp`         | Interactive secure FTP over SSH            |
| `sshfs`        | Mount remote filesystem via SSH (advanced) |

---

## 🔐 Using `scp`

### 📤 Copy local file to remote system:

```bash
scp file.txt user@remote_ip:/home/user/
```

### 📥 Copy remote file to local system:

```bash
scp user@remote_ip:/home/user/file.txt .
```

### 📁 Copy directories recursively:

```bash
scp -r /etc nginx@192.168.1.5:/tmp/config-backup/
```

> ✅ Password prompt appears unless SSH key-based auth is configured.

---

## 🔁 Using `rsync` with SSH

### 📤 Sync local to remote:

```bash
rsync -avz -e ssh /path/to/files/ user@remote_ip:/remote/path/
```

### 📥 Sync remote to local:

```bash
rsync -avz -e ssh user@remote_ip:/remote/files/ /local/path/
```

| Flag     | Meaning                                         |
| -------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `-a`     | Archive mode (preserves permissions/timestamps) |
| `-v`     | Verbose output                                  |
| `-z`     | Compress during transfer                        |
| `-e ssh` | Use SSH for secure transport                    |

> 💡 `rsync` is **faster and more efficient** than `scp`, especially for large or repeated transfers.

---

## 📡 Using `sftp`

### 🔐 Connect to remote system:

```bash
sftp user@remote_ip
```

### 📁 Basic commands in `sftp` shell:

```bash
put file.txt       # Upload
get file.txt       # Download
ls                 # List remote files
lcd /tmp           # Change local dir
cd /etc            # Change remote dir
```

### ❌ Exit:

```bash
bye
```

> 💡 `sftp` is ideal for interactive file transfer when browsing is needed.

## 🧪 Real-World Scenarios

| Scenario                                 | Tool                     |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| 🛠️ Config backup to remote server       | `rsync`                  |
| 📂 One-time file copy                    | `scp`                    |
| 🧾 Upload evidence to remote forensic VM | `sftp`                   |
| 📦 Copy directory of logs                | `scp -r` or `rsync -avz` |
| 🔐 Transfer between cloud VM and local   | All (via SSH access)     |

---

## 🧪 Lab: Secure File Transfers

> 🧪 Practice secure transfers between two systems on the same network or between VM & host.

### 🔧 Setup:

* System A: your local machine or VM
* System B: another VM with SSH enabled
* Ensure SSH is installed and running on both:

```bash
sudo systemctl status ssh
```

---

### ✅ Tasks Checklist

* [x] Create a test file: `echo "Lab data" > lab.txt`
* [x] Transfer to remote with `scp`
* [x] Retrieve with `scp` (remote → local)
* [x] Transfer a directory with `scp -r`
* [x] Use `rsync` to sync `~/Documents` to remote `~/backup`
* [x] Connect using `sftp`, upload, download, and list files

---

## 📌 Key Takeaways

* **Never use `ftp`** or unencrypted transfers on production or forensic systems.
* Use `scp` for simple, one-time secure transfers.
* Prefer `rsync` for efficient, repeatable, and resumable syncs.
* Use `sftp` for interactive, user-friendly file transfer sessions.
* Always verify SSH fingerprints and file integrity on critical transfers.
