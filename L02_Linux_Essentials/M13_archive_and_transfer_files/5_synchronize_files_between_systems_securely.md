## 📘 Introduction

Unlike `scp` which simply copies files, **`rsync`** is a powerful utility that allows for **fast**, **incremental**, and **resumable** synchronization of files between systems. When combined with SSH, `rsync` ensures secure, encrypted transfers.

## 🚀 Why Use rsync Over SSH?

| Feature        | Benefit                                                       |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🔁 Incremental | Only changed parts of files are transferred                   |
| 🔐 Secure      | Encrypted transfer over SSH                                   |
| ⏱️ Efficient   | Compresses files during transfer                              |
| 🛠️ Flexible   | Can exclude files, preserve permissions, set bandwidth limits |

## 🧰 Syntax and Options

```bash
rsync [OPTIONS] -e ssh SOURCE TARGET
```

### Common Options:

| Option       | Purpose                                      |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| `-a`         | Archive (recursive + preserve metadata)      |
| `-v`         | Verbose (show progress)                      |
| `-z`         | Compress data during transfer                |
| `-e ssh`     | Use SSH as transport                         |
| `--delete`   | Delete files on target not present in source |
| `--progress` | Show file transfer progress                  |

## 📤 Syncing from Local to Remote

```bash
rsync -avz -e ssh ~/projects/ user@192.168.56.10:/home/user/projects/
```

* Syncs local `projects/` to remote `/home/user/projects/`
* SSH is used for secure transmission

> ✅ Directory structure, permissions, timestamps are preserved.

---

## 📥 Syncing from Remote to Local

```bash
rsync -avz -e ssh user@192.168.56.10:/home/user/logs/ ~/backups/logs/
```

* Downloads remote logs to a local backup directory

---

## 💾 Preserving File Attributes

By default, `-a` (archive) mode includes:

* File permissions
* Symlinks
* Timestamps
* Devices
* Group/owner IDs (when run as root)

Example:

```bash
rsync -a /var/log/ user@192.168.56.10:/backup/logs/
```

> 🔒 In forensic or compliance work, preserving file metadata is **critical**.

## 🧪 Real-World Use Cases

| Use Case          | Command                                         |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| 🔁 Daily Dev Sync | `rsync -avz ~/dev/ user@devbox:/code/`          |
| 🔐 Secure Backup  | `rsync -avz /etc/ user@backup:/secure/configs/` |
| 🚫 Exclude Files  | `rsync -av --exclude '*.tmp'`                   |
| 📤 Web Deployment | `rsync -az ./site/ user@web:/var/www/html/`     |
| 📜 Log Archiving  | `rsync -az /var/log/ user@log-server:/archive/` |

## 🧪 Lab: Secure File Synchronization

### 🔧 Environment:

* Local system: `user@local`
* Remote system: `user@192.168.56.10`

### ✅ Task Checklist:

1. [x] Create a local folder:

   ```bash
   mkdir ~/sync-test && echo "Hello from $(hostname)" > ~/sync-test/hello.txt
   ```

2. [x] Sync to remote:

   ```bash
   rsync -avz -e ssh ~/sync-test/ user@192.168.56.10:/home/user/sync-test/
   ```

3. [x] Modify a file and re-sync to test incremental copy:

   ```bash
   echo "More data" >> ~/sync-test/hello.txt
   rsync -avz -e ssh ~/sync-test/ user@192.168.56.10:/home/user/sync-test/
   ```

4. [x] Sync remote directory back:

   ```bash
   rsync -avz -e ssh user@192.168.56.10:/home/user/sync-test/ ~/sync-copy/
   ```

5. [x] Add exclusion:

   ```bash
   echo "temp.tmp" > ~/sync-test/temp.tmp
   rsync -avz --exclude '*.tmp' -e ssh ~/sync-test/ user@192.168.56.10:/home/user/sync-test/
   ```

## 📌 Key Takeaways

* `rsync` is **more efficient** than `scp` for large, recurring, or complex transfers
* Use `-avz -e ssh` for **secure, compressed, and attribute-preserving** syncs
* Always verify `rsync` command paths and use `--dry-run` for testing
* Avoid unencrypted transfers; always use SSH with `rsync`
* Use `--exclude`, `--delete`, and `--progress` for control and visibility
