## üéØ Introduction

Monitoring process activity is essential for:

- Identifying CPU- or memory-intensive tasks
- Investigating system slowness or bottlenecks
- Troubleshooting stuck or zombie processes
- Verifying the health of system and user services

> Linux offers powerful tools like `ps`, `top`, and `htop` for **real-time and static monitoring**.

## üß† Why Monitor Process Activity?

| Purpose                           | Benefit                       |
| --------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Detect high CPU or memory usage   | Optimize performance          |
| Spot zombie or stuck processes    | Ensure system stability       |
| Track unauthorized activity       | Improve system security       |
| Monitor long-running scripts/apps | Verify runtime and efficiency |

## üìã Tools to Monitor Processes

| Tool    | Type     | Description                                  |
| ------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `ps`    | Snapshot | Lists current processes at a single point    |
| `top`   | Dynamic  | Real-time process monitor with live stats    |
| `htop`  | Dynamic  | Interactive, colorful, and user-friendly top |
| `pgrep` | Search   | Filters process list by name or pattern      |
| `pidof` | Lookup   | Returns PID of a specific running process    |

---

## üîé Using `ps` ‚Äì Static Snapshot

The `ps` command captures a **one-time snapshot** of all running processes.

### üî∏ Basic Usage

```bash
ps
```

### üî∏ View All Processes

```bash
ps aux
```

| Flag | Meaning                                 |
| ---- | --------------------------------------- |
| `a`  | All users                               |
| `u`  | Show user/CPU/mem columns               |
| `x`  | Show processes not attached to terminal |

### üî∏ Custom Output

```bash
ps -eo pid,ppid,stat,%cpu,%mem,cmd --sort=-%cpu
```

‚úÖ Sorts processes by CPU usage

---

## üìà Using `top` ‚Äì Dynamic Monitor

`top` gives a **live, updating** view of system and process activity.

```bash
top
```

### Key Features

- Sort by CPU or memory
- Press `k` to kill a process
- Press `r` to renice (change priority)
- Press `q` to quit

### Sample Output Columns

| Column    | Description              |
| --------- | ------------------------ |
| `PID`     | Process ID               |
| `%CPU`    | CPU usage                |
| `%MEM`    | Memory usage             |
| `TIME+`   | Total CPU time           |
| `COMMAND` | The command/process name |

---

## üìä Using `htop` ‚Äì Enhanced Interactive Monitor

> Requires installation: `sudo apt install htop` or `sudo yum install htop`

```bash
htop
```

### Features Over `top`

- Color-coded bars
- Scrollable interface
- Use arrow keys to navigate
- Press `F9` to kill a process
- Press `F6` to sort columns

## üîç Other Useful Tools

| Tool                         | Description                         |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `pgrep nginx`                | Returns PID of process by name      |
| `pidof firefox`              | Quick PID lookup by exact name      |
| `watch ps aux`               | Updates `ps` output every 2 seconds |
| `vmstat`, `iostat`, `mpstat` | Advanced system-level metrics       |

## üß† Quiz Yourself

1. What‚Äôs the difference between `ps` and `top`?
2. How do you sort `ps` output by CPU usage?
3. Which tool offers a color-coded, interactive interface?
4. What key in `top` lets you kill a process?
5. How do you list all currently running processes with full details?

## üìé Summary

- Use `ps` for **snapshot** process reporting
- Use `top` or `htop` for **live system monitoring**
- Monitor CPU, memory, and runtime usage for each process
- Tools like `pgrep` and `pidof` help identify PIDs quickly
- Mastering these tools is essential for performance tuning, process debugging, and operational visibility
