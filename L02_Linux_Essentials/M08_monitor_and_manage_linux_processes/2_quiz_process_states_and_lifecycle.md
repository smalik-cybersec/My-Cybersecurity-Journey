---

### 3. **Which of the following best describes the "Waiting" (or "Blocked") state?**

* A) Process has been killed
* B) Process is waiting for a resource or event
* C) Process is being scheduled
* D) Process is executing user instructions
  ‚úÖ **Answer:** B
  *A process in the waiting/blocked state is paused until some condition (like I/O completion) is met.*

### 4. **What does the state code `Z` represent in Linux process management?**

* A) Zombie
* B) Sleeping
* C) Stopped
* D) Running
  ‚úÖ **Answer:** A
  *The `Z` code in `ps` or `top` output stands for a zombie process.*

### 5. **Which process automatically adopts orphan processes in Unix-like systems?**

* A) `/bin/bash`
* B) `sshd`
* C) `init` or `systemd`
* D) `cron`
  ‚úÖ **Answer:** C
  *The `init` process (or `systemd` on newer systems) becomes the parent of orphaned processes and is responsible for cleaning them up.*

---

### 6. **Which of the following transitions is NOT valid in a typical process lifecycle?**

* A) Ready ‚Üí Running
* B) Running ‚Üí Waiting
* C) Waiting ‚Üí Running
* D) Running ‚Üí Terminated
  ‚úÖ **Answer:** C
  *A process must first go back to the Ready state before it can enter the Running state again.*

---

### 7. **What happens if a parent process never performs a `wait()` call for its child?**

* A) The child process keeps running
* B) The system reuses the PID immediately
* C) The child becomes a zombie
* D) The child turns into a daemon
  ‚úÖ **Answer:** C
  *Without `wait()`, the terminated child becomes a zombie process.*

---

### 8. **Which of the following states indicates a process has completed and been fully cleaned up?**

* B) `grep proc`
* C) `ps -eo pid,state,cmd`
* D) `chmod 777`
  ‚úÖ **Answer:** C
  *The `ps` command with options can show process states and commands.*

### 10. **Which of the following is most likely a security risk?**

* A) A running process
* B) A waiting process
