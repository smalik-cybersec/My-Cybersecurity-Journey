## 🎯 Introduction

Linux allows you to manage multiple **jobs** (processes) in a terminal. These jobs can run in the **foreground** (actively using the terminal) or **background** (running quietly in the background while you do other tasks).

> Understanding job control helps in multitasking, script automation, and managing user-space applications without closing terminal sessions.

---

## 🧠 What Is a Job in Linux?

A **job** in Linux refers to a **process started from the shell**. You can manage it using job control tools like `jobs`, `fg`, `bg`, and signals (`Ctrl+Z`, `Ctrl+C`).

Each job:

* Has a **job ID** (shown with `%`)
* May have an associated **process ID (PID)**
* Can be suspended, resumed, or terminated

## 🔁 Job Types: Foreground vs Background

| Job Type       | Description                                          | Example         |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| **Foreground** | Takes over the terminal and blocks other input       | `nano file.txt` |
| **Background** | Runs in the background without blocking the terminal | `sleep 30 &`    |

---

## 🛠️ Job Control Commands

| Command      | Description                         |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| `jobs`       | List current jobs in the shell      |
| `fg %n`      | Bring job `%n` to foreground        |
| `bg %n`      | Resume job `%n` in background       |
| `Ctrl+Z`     | Suspend a foreground job            |
| `kill %n`    | Send termination signal to job `%n` |
| `kill -9 %n` | Forcefully terminate job `%n`       |
| `disown %n`  | Remove job from shell tracking      |

---

## 🔀 Switching Between Jobs

### Suspend a Job

```bash
Ctrl + Z
```

✅ This pauses the running job and returns you to the shell.

### Resume in Background

```bash
bg %1
```

✅ Job continues running, and you get your terminal back.

### Resume in Foreground

```bash
fg %1
```

✅ Terminal resumes interaction with the job.

---

## 🔍 Viewing and Managing Jobs

### Check Job Status

```bash
jobs
```

Output:

```bash
[1]+  Running    sleep 300 &
[2]-  Stopped    nano file.txt
```

### Check PID of a Job

```bash
ps
```

or

```bash
ps -u $USER | grep sleep
```

---

## 🧪 Practical Job Control Examples

```bash
# Run a background job
sleep 120 &

# Suspend a job manually
gedit file.txt
# Press Ctrl + Z

# List jobs
jobs

# Resume editor in background
bg %2

# Kill the sleep job
kill %1
```

## 🧠 Quiz Yourself

1. What key combination suspends a job in the terminal?
2. How do you bring a job back to the foreground?
3. Which command removes a job from the shell's job list?
4. What is the difference between `bg` and `fg`?
5. What happens if you close the terminal while jobs are running in the background?

---

## 📎 Summary

* Linux lets you run, suspend, and resume jobs directly from the terminal
* Use `&` to run a job in the background, `Ctrl+Z` to suspend, `bg`/`fg` to resume
* Each job has a `%` job ID, and can be viewed with `jobs`
* Use `kill` to terminate jobs and `disown` to detach them from the shell
* Job control is crucial for multitasking and session management in user shells
