# üß© Quiz: Register Systems for Red Hat Support

**Module:** 14 ‚Äì Install and Update Software Packages
**Track:** Linux Essentials ‚Äì Level 3
**Topic:** Quiz on Red Hat System Registration
**Focus:** Scenario-based questions, real log samples, and detection skills

---

## 1. üîé Introduction

This quiz validates your deep understanding of Red Hat system registration using `subscription-manager`, including command usage, repository behavior, and blue team detection. These scenarios reflect real-world break/fix, attack simulation, and compliance checks ‚Äî essential for SOC analysts, system admins, and red teamers.

---

## 2. üß† Core Concepts Recap

Before jumping in, quickly recall:

* `subscription-manager` is the **gatekeeper** to Red Hat software repositories.
* Without valid registration, `dnf` cannot fetch or install packages.
* Logs in `/var/log/rhsm/rhsm.log` and `/var/log/messages` are critical for audit and detection.
* Activation Keys = non-interactive registration (often used in automation).
* Rogue registration = a possible T1078 (Valid Accounts) abuse scenario.

## 3. üß© Quiz Questions (Scenario-Based + Log Analysis)

### **Q1: Basic Registration Flow**

You installed RHEL 9.3 and ran:

```bash
sudo dnf install wget
```

You got the following error:

```
This system is not registered with an entitlement server.
You can use subscription-manager to register.
```

**What‚Äôs your next action?**

A. Clear DNF cache
B. Add EPEL repo manually
C. Run `subscription-manager register`
D. Reboot the system

‚úÖ **Correct:** C. You must register before accessing Red Hat repositories.

---

### **Q2: Subscription Trouble**

After running this:

```bash
sudo subscription-manager register --username shahid --password ********
```

You got:

```
The system has been registered with ID: 56a4-98e3...
No subscriptions are available for auto-attachment.
```

**What does this mean?**

A. The password is wrong
B. The repo is missing
C. Your account has no entitlements
D. The system is already registered

‚úÖ **Correct:** C. You registered, but Red Hat says there are **no valid subscriptions** to attach.

---

### **Q3: Attack Simulation**

A red team simulation involved registering a RHEL VM using leaked credentials. Blue Team wants to investigate.

**Which file would you check for registration evidence?**

A. `/var/log/audit/audit.log`
B. `/var/log/secure`
C. `/var/log/rhsm/rhsm.log`
D. `/etc/shadow`

‚úÖ **Correct:** C. All `subscription-manager` activity is logged in `rhsm.log`.

---

### **Q4: System Status**

You're asked to verify if a RHEL VM is actively registered. Which command gives the **fastest answer**?

A. `dnf repolist`
B. `subscription-manager identity`
C. `subscription-manager repos --list`
D. `subscription-manager status`

‚úÖ **Correct:** D. It shows whether the system is fully entitled and registered.

---

### **Q5: Log Interpretation**

You read this in `/var/log/rhsm/rhsm.log`:

```
[ERROR] Unable to attach subscription: system is already entitled
```

**What does it mean?**

A. You need to unregister first
B. Another system is using your key
C. The subscription is active already
D. The password expired

‚úÖ **Correct:** C. The system already has an active entitlement.

---

## 4. üìÇ Bonus: Command Output Interpretation

You run:

```bash
sudo subscription-manager identity
```

And receive:

```
system identity: f9cdee29-f847-45f3-81a6-8b9e5e5a5131
name: rhel-server-1.local
org name: Craw Cybersecurity Lab
```

**What does this confirm?**

‚úÖ The system is registered and recognized by Red Hat with a valid UUID.

## 5. üìå Summary Table + Checklist

| Task                                     | ‚úÖ Status |
| ---------------------------------------- | -------- |
| Identified unregistered system errors    | ‚úÖ        |
| Diagnosed entitlement issues             | ‚úÖ        |
| Found and interpreted `rhsm.log` entries | ‚úÖ        |
| Understood activation key usage          | ‚úÖ        |
| Mapped to MITRE ATT\&CK techniques       | ‚úÖ        |

## 6. üìö Journaling + Confidence Tracker

> Today I solidified my understanding of system registration flow in RHEL using real-world troubleshooting scenarios. I now know how to read subscription logs, fix entitlement issues, and help the blue team trace misuse. I'm comfortable with the key commands and their expected behavior.

üü© **Confidence Level:** 9 / 10
üìù **Personal Notes:**

* Try a simulated lab with no subscription.
* Review activation key setup for automation later.
