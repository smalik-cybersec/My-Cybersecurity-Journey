# üì¶ **Module 14: Install and Update Software Packages**

**Course:** Linux Essentials ‚Äì Level 3
**Protocol:** Cybersecurity Documentation Protocol ‚Äî Ultra Edition v5.0 (Master Grade Edition)
**Platform:** RHEL 9.x
**Purpose:** Complete professional review of **Module 14** to assist long-term retention, spaced repetition, and GitHub/Obsidian documentation publishing.

---

## üîé **1. Module Overview**

This module focuses on **package management** in Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) using both low-level and high-level tools: `rpm`, `dnf`, and software repositories. Mastery of these tools ensures **secure, efficient, and traceable software management**‚Äîa foundational competency across Red/Blue team roles, DevSecOps, and system administration.

---

## üß± **2. Lessons Covered (with Key Concepts)**

---

### ‚úÖ **1. Register Systems for Red Hat Support**

* **Purpose:** Connect the system to Red Hat's customer portal to access official repositories.
* **Tool:** `subscription-manager`
* **Command Used:**

  ```bash
  sudo subscription-manager register
  sudo subscription-manager attach --auto
  sudo subscription-manager repos --list-enabled
  ```
* **Risks:** Unregistered systems can‚Äôt receive updates or security patches.

---

### ‚úÖ **2. Quiz: Register Systems for Red Hat Support**

* Covered:

  * Real-world troubleshooting of registration errors
  * Logs in `/var/log/rhsm/rhsm.log`
  * Practical errors (403, 404, SSL issues)

---

### ‚úÖ **3. Explain and Investigate RPM Software Packages**

* **RPM** is the **low-level** package manager in RHEL.
* **Key Commands:**

  ```bash
  rpm -q <package>
  rpm -qi <package>
  rpm -ql <package>
  rpm -Va
  rpm -K <rpmfile>
  ```
* **Validation & Integrity:** RPM verifies packages via checksums and GPG keys.
* **Feynman Analogy:** Think of RPM as a librarian who catalogs every book (package) and can tell you **what**, **where**, and **who installed** it.

---

### ‚úÖ **4. Guided Exercise: Explain and Investigate RPM Software Packages**

* You practiced:

  * Querying, listing, verifying, and inspecting installed packages
  * File paths (like `/usr/bin`, `/etc`, `/usr/share/doc`)
  * Viewing metadata for digital forensics

---

### ‚úÖ **5. Install and Update Software Packages with DNF**

* **DNF (Dandified Yum)** is the **modern high-level** RHEL package manager.
* Supports:

  * Dependency resolution
  * Repo management
  * Rollbacks and history
* **Key Commands:**

  ```bash
  sudo dnf install <package>
  sudo dnf update
  sudo dnf info <package>
  sudo dnf history list
  ```

---

### ‚úÖ **6. Guided Exercise: Install and Update Software Packages with DNF**

* Installed `vim-enhanced`
* Queried metadata
* Simulated a rollback
* Inspected `/var/log/dnf.log`
* Used:

  ```bash
  dnf search
  dnf history rollback
  dnf clean all
  ```

---

### ‚úÖ **7. Enable DNF Software Repositories**

* Enabled, disabled, and verified `.repo` files:

  ```bash
  sudo dnf config-manager --set-enabled <repo>
  sudo dnf repolist
  sudo vi /etc/yum.repos.d/*.repo
  ```
* **Security Note:** Repositories should be signed, validated, and monitored (e.g., `gpgcheck=1`)

---

### ‚úÖ **8. Guided Exercise: Enable DNF Software Repositories**

* Modified `.repo` files manually
* Checked `gpgcheck`, `enabled`, `baseurl`
* Practiced creating a custom `.repo` for simulation use

---

### ‚úÖ **9. Lab: Install and Update Software Packages**

**Full Workflow Covered:**

| Task           | Tools Used             | Outcome                           |
| -------------- | ---------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Search package | `dnf search`           | Located package variants          |

| Query          | `dnf info`, `rpm -qi`  | Checked repo, version, size       |
| Validate       | `rpm -K`, `rpm -Va`    | Ensured package integrity         |
| Update         | `dnf update`           | Pulled in new version             |
| Rollback       | `dnf history rollback` | Simulated reverting faulty update |
| Logs           | `/var/log/dnf.log`     | Investigated historical installs  |

---

## ‚öîÔ∏è **3. Red/Blue Team Simulation Highlights**

### üî¥ Red Team:

* Spoof malicious `.rpm` file
* Poison `.repo` file with MITM
* Exploit unauthenticated DNF or misconfigured proxy

### üîµ Blue Team:

* Monitor:

  * `/var/log/dnf.log`
  * `/etc/yum.repos.d/*.repo`
* Detect:

  * Unsigned RPM installs
  * Unauthorized repository additions
* Mitigation:

  * Enforce `gpgcheck=1`
  * Use FIM (File Integrity Monitoring) on repo config
