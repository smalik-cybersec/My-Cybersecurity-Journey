## 🎯 What Are File Links?

In Linux, a **link** is a way to reference a file **from multiple locations**. It lets you access a single file using different names or paths — like aliases or shortcuts.

> Links are especially useful for organizing files, managing configs, backups, or pointing scripts to shared resources.

## 🔗 Types of Links in Linux

| Type              | Command               | Description                                  |
| ----------------- | --------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Hard Link**     | `ln source target`    | Direct pointer to the same file content      |
| **Symbolic Link** | `ln -s source target` | A shortcut or reference to the original file |

---

## ⚙️ How Hard Links Work

- **Point directly to the file’s inode** (metadata and content block).
- The link **is indistinguishable** from the original file.
- **If the original file is deleted, the hard link still works**.

```bash
ln original.txt hardlink.txt
```

### Example

```bash
touch original.txt
ln original.txt hardlink.txt
ls -li
```

> Note: Hard links cannot link to directories or cross filesystems.

---

## 🌐 How Symbolic (Soft) Links Work

- Points to the **path** of the original file.
- If the original is deleted, the symlink becomes **broken**.
- Works across filesystems and can link to directories too.

```bash
ln -s original.txt symlink.txt
```

### Example

```bash
ln -s /etc/passwd my_passwd
ls -l
```

---

## 🧪 Practical Examples

```bash
# Create an original file
echo "Hello Shahid" > hello.txt

# Create a hard link
ln hello.txt hard_hello.txt

# Create a symbolic (soft) link
ln -s hello.txt soft_hello.txt

# List all and show inode numbers
ls -li
```

## 🧠 Key Differences: Hard vs Symbolic Links

| Feature                            | Hard Link          | Symbolic Link (Symlink) |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------ | ----------------------- |
| **Points to**                      | File’s inode       | File’s pathname         |
| **Breaks if original is deleted?** | ❌ No               | ✅ Yes                   |
| **Can link to directories?**       | ❌ No               | ✅ Yes                   |
| **Cross filesystem allowed?**      | ❌ No               | ✅ Yes                   |
| **Creation command**               | `ln file linkname` | `ln -s file linkname`   |

---

## 🔍 Checking Links

### View all files with inode numbers

```bash
ls -li
```

### Identify symbolic links

```bash
ls -l
```

Symbolic links will appear like:

```text
soft_hello.txt -> hello.txt
```

### Verify link target

```bash
readlink soft_hello.txt
```

## 🧪 Lab Exercise

Try the following:

```bash
# Create working directory
mkdir ~/link_lab && cd ~/link_lab

# Create a file
echo "Link Testing" > file.txt

# Create a hard link
ln file.txt file_hard.txt

# Create a symbolic link
ln -s file.txt file_soft.txt

# Modify original
echo "More Data" >> file.txt

# View contents of all three
cat file.txt
cat file_hard.txt
cat file_soft.txt

# Delete original file
rm file.txt

# Try to access links again
cat file_hard.txt    # Should still work
cat file_soft.txt    # Should show broken link error
```

## 🧠 Quiz Yourself

1. What is a hard link, and how is it different from a symbolic link?
2. Can hard links be created for directories? Why or why not?
3. Write the command to create a symbolic link to `/etc/passwd` called `my_passwd`.
4. What happens to a symbolic link if the original file is deleted?
5. Which command shows where a symbolic link points?

## 📎 Summary

- Linux supports **two types of links**: hard and symbolic (soft).
- Hard links are **indistinguishable from the original file** and survive deletion of the original.
- Symbolic links are like **shortcuts** that break if the original is deleted.
- Use `ln` for hard links and `ln -s` for symbolic links.
- Links are essential in **system config, security audits, log redirection**, and **resource organization**.
