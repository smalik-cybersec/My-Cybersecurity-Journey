The "Lab: Control Access to Files" is a practical exercise designed to help you understand and configure file and directory permissions in a Linux environment. This lab builds upon concepts covered in the "Manage Default Permissions and File Access" section and its guided exercise, focusing on how permissions, including special bits, affect user and group collaboration.

The **main objectives** of this lab are to:
*   **Configure permissions on files**.
*   **Set up a directory where users can work collaboratively on files**.
*   **Create files that are automatically assigned group ownership**.
*   **Create files that are not accessible outside the group**.

**Key Concepts Demonstrated in the Lab:**

1.  **File and Directory Access Permissions:**
    *   Linux is a multi-user operating system that requires regulating user access to files and directories for system security.
    *   Permissions are controlled for **three user categories**: the file's owner (user), the owning group, and all other users on the system (others or world).
    *   Each category can have **read (r), write (w), and execute (x) permissions**. A dash (`-`) indicates the absence of a permission.
    *   The `chmod` command is used to **change permissions**. Permissions can be set using:
        *   **Symbolic notation** (e.g., `u+r`, `g-w`, `o=x`).
        *   **Octal (numeric) notation** (e.g., `755`, `644`). Each permission has a numeric value: read=4, write=2, execute=1.
    *   The lab specifically requires setting permissions on the `/home/techdocs` directory and modifying global login scripts to set a specific `umask`.

2.  **Special Permissions:**
    *   These are a fourth type of permission in addition to user, group, and others. The lab covers `setgid` and `sticky bit`.
    *   **Set Group ID (SGID) on directories (`g+s` or leading octal `2`)**: When SGID is set on a directory, new files and subdirectories created within it **inherit their group ownership from the directory**, rather than from the user's primary group. This is essential for **group collaboration**. The lab explicitly focuses on creating a directory for group collaboration and ensuring new files get automatic group ownership.
    *   **Sticky Bit (`o+t` or leading octal `1`)**: When applied to a directory, it ensures that **only the owner of a file (or the root user) can remove or rename that file** within that directory, even if others have write permissions. This is crucial for shared public writable directories. The lab requires setting up the directory to "ensure non-owners cannot delete files".

3.  **Default Permissions and `umask`:**
    *   The `umask` command controls the **default permissions assigned to newly created files and directories**. It acts as a mask that *removes* permissions from an initial default value (e.g., 0666 for files, 0777 for directories).
    *   The lab includes an instruction to "Modify the global login scripts. Normal users should have a umask setting that allows the user and group to create, write and execute files and directories, while preventing other users from viewing, modifying, or executing new files and directories". This reinforces how `umask` dictates access rights for new objects.

**Relevant Commands:**
*   **`chmod`**: To change permissions.
*   **`chown`**: To change file or directory owner and/or group owner.
*   **`chgrp`**: To change group ownership.
*   **`umask`**: To display or set the default permission mask.

This lab provides hands-on experience in implementing robust file access controls using standard and special permissions, which is critical for system security and collaboration in a Linux environment. You can expect to perform tasks such as creating users and groups, setting group ownership, and applying special permission bits on a designated directory.
