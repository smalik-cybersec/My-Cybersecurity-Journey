# 📝 Summary – **Manage Networking in Linux**

---

## 📘 Overview

In the **Linux Essentials – Manage Networking** module, you learned how to inspect, configure, and troubleshoot networking from the command line. Mastering this skill is **fundamental** for both system administrators and cybersecurity professionals.

Whether you're managing a server, securing a network, or performing a forensic investigation, understanding Linux networking ensures reliable, secure, and efficient communication.

## 🔧 Core Topics Covered

| Topic                       | Description                                                                       |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Network Interfaces**      | Identified and managed interfaces using `ip link`, `ip addr`                      |
| **Static IP Assignment**    | Assigned IPs temporarily and permanently via CLI and config files                 |
| **Routing**                 | Viewed and set up default gateways using `ip route`                               |
| **DNS Resolution**          | Configured `/etc/resolv.conf` and tested using `dig`, `ping`                      |
| **Hostname Management**     | Viewed, set, and persisted system hostname with `hostnamectl` and `/etc/hostname` |
| **Local Name Resolution**   | Used `/etc/hosts` to resolve hostnames without DNS                                |
| **Live Traffic Monitoring** | Captured and inspected packets using `tcpdump`                                    |

## 🧠 Key Commands

```bash
# Interface and IP info
ip addr show
ip link show

# Routing
ip route
sudo ip route add default via <gateway>

# DNS & resolution
cat /etc/resolv.conf
dig google.com

# Hostname
hostnamectl
hostname -f

# Local resolution
cat /etc/hosts

# Packet capture
sudo tcpdump -i eth0 icmp
```

## 🧪 Labs Completed

* Validated IP, DNS, and hostname configuration
* Assigned temporary and persistent static IPs
* Configured local name resolution and DNS servers
* Captured traffic using `tcpdump`
* Reboot-tested persistent configurations

---

## 🔒 Cybersecurity Relevance

✅ Misconfigured IP or DNS can:

* Break encrypted communications
* Open the door to **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM)** attacks
* Prevent essential tools (like Nmap, Snort, Suricata) from working
* Interfere with SIEM/log correlation due to bad hostname entries

As a cybersecurity student or professional, **networking mastery is non-negotiable**.

---

## 📌 Final Takeaways

* Use the `ip` command suite instead of legacy tools like `ifconfig`.
* Validate every layer: interface, IP, route, DNS, hostname.
* Understand both temporary and persistent configuration methods.
* Always test with `ping`, `dig`, `traceroute`, and `tcpdump`.
* Troubleshooting begins with **visibility**: learn to see what’s broken before guessing.
