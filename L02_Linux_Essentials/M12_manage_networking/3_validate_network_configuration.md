## 📘 Introduction

Validating network configuration is a fundamental skill every Linux professional must possess. It allows you to quickly confirm whether your system can communicate on the network, resolve DNS names, reach the internet, and route packets correctly.

---

## 🌐 Why Network Validation Matters

| Concern                 | Why It Matters                                 |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Misconfigured IP        | Can isolate the system from the network        |
| Incorrect DNS           | Causes failures in domain name resolution      |
| Missing Default Gateway | System can’t reach outside the local network   |
| Down Interface          | Prevents any form of network communication     |
| Wrong Hostname          | Breaks services that depend on name resolution |

---

## 🧰 Essential Commands

### 🔎 1. Check Interface and IP Address

```bash
ip addr show
```

> View interface names, IPs, loopback status, and MAC addresses.

### ⚙️ 2. Check Interface State (Up/Down)

```bash
ip link show
```

> Look for `state UP` or `DOWN` per interface.

---

### 📍 3. Display Routing Table

```bash
ip route
```

> Shows default gateway and interface routes.

Example output:

```bash
default via 192.168.1.1 dev eth0
192.168.1.0/24 dev eth0 proto kernel scope link src 192.168.1.10
```

---

### 🌐 4. Check DNS Configuration

```bash
cat /etc/resolv.conf
```

> Displays current DNS servers used for name resolution.

---

### 🏷 5. View Hostname & FQDN

```bash
hostname
hostname -f
```

> Validates local machine name used in local and network services.

---

### 📶 6. Ping a Host

```bash
ping -c 4 google.com
```

> Tests both IP connectivity and DNS resolution.

---

### 🔍 7. Trace Route to a Host

```bash
traceroute google.com
```

> Maps the route taken by packets to reach a destination.

---

### 🧪 8. Use `nmcli` for Systems with NetworkManager

```bash
nmcli device status
nmcli connection show
```

> Useful in modern distros (especially desktops and servers with GUI).

---

## 🛠 Real-World Scenarios

| Problem                        | Validation Step                               |            |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| No internet access             | `ip route`, `ping 8.8.8.8`, `ping google.com` |            |
| DNS resolution failing         | Check `/etc/resolv.conf`, use `dig`           |            |
| Hostname not resolving locally | Check `/etc/hosts`, `hostname -f`             |            |
| Interface not working          | `ip link show`, `ethtool eth0`                |            |
| Intermittent connection        | `ping`, `traceroute`, \`dmesg                 | grep eth\` |

## 🧪 Lab Exercise: Validate Network Config

> 💻 **Objective**: Fully validate a network interface and its configuration.

### ✅ Tasks Checklist

* [x] List all active interfaces with IPs.
* [x] Verify your system’s default gateway.
* [x] Check your DNS nameservers.
* [x] Test hostname resolution (`hostname`, `hostname -f`).
* [x] Ping internal and external hosts.
* [x] Trace route to `8.8.8.8`.
* [x] Check interface link with `ethtool` or `nmcli`.

---

## 📝 Summary

Knowing how to validate a network setup is a **must-have survival skill** for any Linux admin or cybersecurity professional. These tools and techniques can help you **pinpoint misconfigurations**, detect **connectivity issues**, and prepare the system for secure operation.

---

## 📌 Key Takeaways

* Use `ip` commands for interface, route, and link status.
* Use `ping`, `traceroute`, `dig`, and `nslookup` for connectivity and DNS checks.
* `hostname`, `/etc/hosts`, and `/etc/resolv.conf` affect local identity and resolution.
* Validate your network **before troubleshooting complex services** (like SSH, web servers, or firewalls).
