## 🎯 Introduction

Linux uses **groups** to manage and control access for collections of users. Group-based access control helps administrators apply consistent security policies and manage file permissions efficiently.

> Instead of giving access to individual users, you assign access to a group — simplifying permissions and improving scalability and security.

## 🧠 What Are Groups in Linux?

A **group** is a logical collection of users. Each file or process on the system is associated with a **group owner** in addition to a user owner.

Each user:

- Has **one primary group**
- May belong to **multiple supplementary groups**

## 📦 Group Types

| Type                   | Description                                                                     |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Primary Group**      | Assigned when the user is created. Each file they create belongs to this group. |
| **Secondary Group(s)** | Optional groups for additional access rights.                                   |
| **System Groups**      | Special-purpose groups used by system services or packages.                     |

---

## 📁 Group Information Files

| File           | Purpose                                        |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `/etc/group`   | Lists all groups and their members             |
| `/etc/gshadow` | Stores encrypted group passwords (rarely used) |

View all groups:

```bash
cat /etc/group
```

## ⚙️ Commands for Group Management

| Task                       | Command Example                             |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Create a new group         | `sudo groupadd developers`                  |
| Delete a group             | `sudo groupdel developers`                  |
| Modify a group name        | `sudo groupmod -n devs developers`          |
| Add a user to a group      | `sudo usermod -aG developers shahid`        |
| Remove a user from a group | Manually edit `/etc/group` or use `gpasswd` |
| View group membership      | `groups shahid`                             |

🔹 Note: `-aG` adds without removing from existing groups.
Always use `-a` (append) with `-G`, or you will overwrite all group memberships!

---

## 🧪 Practical Examples

```bash
# Create a new group
sudo groupadd analysts

# Add a user to the group
sudo usermod -aG analysts shahid

# Verify group membership
groups shahid

# Rename group
sudo groupmod -n security analysts

# Delete group
sudo groupdel security
```

## 🔐 Why Groups Matter in Cybersecurity

| Use Case                    | Purpose                                |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| 🔐 File access control      | Set group ownership on sensitive files |
| 🔍 Audit and monitoring     | Log activity by group (e.g., `admins`) |
| 🛡️ Enforce least privilege | Only give groups access when required  |
| 📁 Shared access control    | Multiple users managing one project    |
| ⚙️ Service permissions      | E.g., `docker`, `adm`, `wheel`, `sudo` |

## 🧠 Quiz Yourself

1. What is the difference between a primary and a secondary group?
2. Which command adds a user to a group without removing them from others?
3. What file contains all group definitions?
4. How do you rename a group in Linux?
5. Why is it important to use `-aG` with `usermod`?

## 📎 Summary

- Linux groups allow collective permission management
- Each user has one **primary group**, and zero or more **secondary groups**
- Group info is stored in `/etc/group` and `/etc/gshadow`
- Use `groupadd`, `groupdel`, `groupmod`, and `usermod -aG` to manage groups
- Proper group management improves security, organization, and access control
