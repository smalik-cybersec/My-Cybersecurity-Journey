## 📖 Overview

In Linux, **local users and groups** are essential components of the system’s **identity and access control model**. Every file, process, and command execution is tied to a user and a group. This module focused on how to **create**, **modify**, **lock**, **expire**, and **delete** user and group accounts securely from the command line.

## 🛡️ Why This Matters in Cybersecurity

| Purpose                     | Why It’s Important                       |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Identity Management         | Ensures authorized user access           |
| Least Privilege Enforcement | Group roles reduce over-privileged users |
| Shared Access               | Group-based permissions improve control  |
| Auditability & Compliance   | Track and manage account lifecycle       |
| System Hardening            | Lock inactive accounts, expire passwords |
