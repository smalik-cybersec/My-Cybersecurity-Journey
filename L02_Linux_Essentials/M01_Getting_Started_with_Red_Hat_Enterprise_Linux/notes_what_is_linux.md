# What Is Linux?

### 1. Core Concept
> Linux is an open-source operating system (OS) that manages computer hardware and software resources, allowing users to run programs and interact with their computer.

Linux is an operating system, similar to Windows or macOS, but it's unique because it's open source. This means its underlying code is freely available for anyone to view, use, modify, and distribute. It was developed as a free alternative to the UNIX operating system, with the Linux kernel being the central part that manages everything.

### 2. Why It's Important
* **In Cybersecurity, we use this for:** Securing systems, performing penetration testing, analyzing security threats, and developing specialized security tools. Its open-source nature allows cybersecurity professionals to understand how it works at a deep level and customize it for specific security needs.

### 3. Practical Example
```bash
# Example: Checking the Linux kernel version
# The 'uname' command with the '-r' option displays the kernel release.
uname -r
