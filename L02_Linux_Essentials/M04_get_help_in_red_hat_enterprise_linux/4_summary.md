The "Custom Summary" on **page 115** of the `rh124-9.0-student-guide.pdf` serves as the concluding summary for **Chapter 4: Get Help in Red Hat Enterprise Linux**. This chapter, along with its guided exercises and labs (such as "Guided Exercise: Read Manual Pages" on page 104 and "Lab: Get Help in Red Hat Enterprise Linux" on page 108), is designed to equip you with crucial skills for effectively utilising Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL)'s local documentation and help systems [my previous turn].

Here's a comprehensive overview of the key concepts for getting help in RHEL:

*   **Manual Pages (`man` pages):**
    *   **Purpose and Importance:** Man pages are a **fundamental and primary source of documentation** in RHEL, considered the main information resource for commands and files [my previous turn]. Proficiency with them is essential for RHEL administration skills [my previous turn].
    *   **Viewing:** You typically use the `man` command to view manual pages from the command line [my previous turn]. For example, `man 7 signal` provides specific details about signals. You can also use `man systemd.service` to find information on service unit file options.
    *   **Structure:** Man pages are organised into a succinct style with several standard sections, including `NAME` (subject name and brief description), `SYNOPSIS` (command syntax summary), `DESCRIPTION` (basic understanding of the topic), `OPTIONS` (explanation of command execution options), `EXAMPLES` (how to use the command), `FILES` (related files and directories), `ALSO` (related man page topics), `BUGS`, and `AUTHOR`.
    *   **Numbered Sections:** Information within man pages is categorised into **nine numbered sections** based on content type [my previous turn]. For instance, **Section 1** covers user commands (e.g., `passwd(1)`), while **Section 5** covers file formats (e.g., `passwd(5)` for `/etc/passwd`) [my previous turn]. To view a specific section, you explicitly include the section number, such as `man 5 passwd` [my previous turn].
    *   **Navigation:** While viewing a man page (often with a pager like `less`), you can navigate by searching for text strings (e.g., `/string`), moving between occurrences (`n` or `N`), and quitting the view (`q`) [my previous turn].
    *   **Searching:** The `apropos` command, or its equivalent `man -k keyword`, can be used to search for keywords within man page names and their short descriptions [my previous turn, 293, 308]. The `whatis` command provides a concise, one-line description for a specified command or file from the man page database [my previous turn].

*   **Info Pages (`info`):**
    *   **Purpose:** Info pages generally offer **more detailed documentation** than typical man pages [my previous turn, 294].
    *   **Viewing:** You access them using the `info` command, for example, `info info` to learn about the info system itself.
    *   **Structure and Navigation:** Info files are structured as a tree of individual nodes, with each node containing a specific topic. They include **hyperlinks** indicated by leading asterisks, which you can activate by placing the cursor on them and pressing `Enter`. Key navigation commands within info pages include `?` for help, `N` to move to the next node, `L` to display the last page read, `T` to return to the top page of a topic, and `Q` to exit the info system.

*   **Other Local Documentation Sources:**
    *   **`/usr/share/doc` Directory:** This directory is a significant location for program documentation on your system [my previous turn, 294, 511, 528]. Subdirectories within `/usr/share/doc` typically bear the name and version number of the installed package, often including a `COPYING` file specifying the software's license. The quality of documentation in this location can vary depending on its developers.
    *   **`--help` Option:** Many commands offer a quick usage message or display a help screen when invoked with the `--help` option [my previous turn].
    *   **Configuration File Comments:** You can often find explanations and guidelines within configuration files themselves (e.g., `/etc/ntp.conf`), where comments, typically starting with a hash mark (`#`), describe the purpose of settings or blocks of lines.

*   **Importance for Red Hat Certification (RHCSA):**
    *   Local documentation is a **critical resource for the Red Hat Certified System Administrator (RHCSA) exam** [my previous turn, 507]. Candidates **typically do not have access to the Internet** during the RHCSA exam, making familiarity with the local system's `man` and `info` pages, as well as files in `/usr/share/doc` directories, essential for successfully completing the hands-on tasks [my previous turn, 407].
