## 🎯 Introduction

Linux is well-known for its powerful built-in documentation system: **manual pages** (commonly called **man pages**). These are essential resources that explain how commands, configuration files, system calls, and more work.

> Instead of Googling every command, **`man` pages make your Linux system self-documented.**

---

## 📘 What Are Manual Pages ("man pages")?

**Man pages** are detailed, sectioned documents built into Unix/Linux systems that describe:

* Commands
* Configuration file formats
* System calls
* Library functions
* Kernel interfaces

The `man` command is used to access them.

## ⚙️ Basic Syntax of the `man` Command

```bash
man [section] command
```

### Examples:

```bash
man ls           # View the manual for 'ls'
man 5 passwd     # View section 5 (file format) for /etc/passwd
man -k ssh       # Search all man pages for "ssh"
```

## 📂 Structure of a `man` Page

Each man page is divided into sections. Typical headers include:

| Section         | Description                               |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **NAME**        | Name and brief description of the command |
| **SYNOPSIS**    | Command syntax and usage                  |
| **DESCRIPTION** | Detailed functionality                    |
| **OPTIONS**     | Flags and arguments                       |
| **FILES**       | Related files                             |
| **EXAMPLES**    | Usage examples                            |
| **SEE ALSO**    | Related commands                          |
