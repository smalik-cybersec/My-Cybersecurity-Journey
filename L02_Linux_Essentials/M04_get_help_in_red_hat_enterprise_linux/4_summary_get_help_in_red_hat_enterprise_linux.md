## 📖 Overview

Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) provides a powerful set of **built-in documentation tools** to help users get assistance without needing to search online. These tools include:

* `man` (manual pages)
* `--help` command-line option
* `whatis` (one-line summaries)
* `apropos` (search by keyword)
* `info` (structured documentation)

These are essential for **system administration, cybersecurity, scripting**, and **troubleshooting**.

## 🧰 Key Tools and Their Purpose

| Tool      | Description                                               | Example Usage   |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| `man`     | Full manual pages for commands, files, system calls, etc. | `man cp`        |
| `--help`  | Brief usage guide and available options for most commands | `ls --help`     |
| `whatis`  | One-line summary of a command                             | `whatis passwd` |
| `apropos` | Searches man pages for relevant topics                    | `apropos user`  |
| `info`    | More structured and detailed documentation                | `info mkdir`    |

## 🔍 Differences Between Help Tools

| Feature         | `man`      | `--help`     | `whatis`   | `apropos`     | `info`       |
| --------------- | ---------- | ------------ | ---------- | ------------- | ------------ |
| Detail Level    | High       | Low          | Very Low   | Medium        | High         |
| Navigation      | Scrollable | None         | One-line   | One-line list | Structured   |
| Internet Needed | ❌ No       | ❌ No         | ❌ No       | ❌ No          | ❌ No         |
| Suitable For    | Deep usage | Quick syntax | Quick idea | Topic search  | Full manuals |

## 🔐 Why This Matters in Cybersecurity

* **Reduces dependency on internet** during secure or air-gapped operations
* Enables deep understanding of **command options**, **exit codes**, and **configuration files**
* Supports security tasks like hardening (`man 5 shadow`, `man 8 iptables`)
* Promotes **self-reliance**, speed, and system integrity during audits or breaches

---

## ✅ What You Should Be Able to Do Now

* Use `man`, `--help`, and `info` to learn and troubleshoot commands
* Find related commands using `apropos` or `man -k`
* Quickly verify what a command does with `whatis`
* Identify and navigate man sections (e.g., user commands, config files, admin tools)

## 🧠 Example Practice

```bash
man 5 passwd           # View structure of /etc/passwd
mkdir --help           # View usage options
whatis systemctl       # Get short command summary
apropos firewall       # Search all help topics about firewalls
info mkdir             # View detailed GNU docs for mkdir
```

## 🔚 Final Thoughts

> Mastering these help tools transforms you from a command user into a Linux problem-solver.

Whether you're configuring firewalls, analyzing logs, or writing automation scripts, knowing how to **get help locally** is a key skill in your Red Hat and cybersecurity journey.
