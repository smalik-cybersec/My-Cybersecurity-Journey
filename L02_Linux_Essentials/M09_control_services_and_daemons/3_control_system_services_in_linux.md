## 🎯 Introduction

Linux system services—also called **daemons**—run in the background and handle essential functions such as networking, scheduled tasks, remote access, and logging.

Using **`systemctl`**, you can **start, stop, enable, disable, reload, and restart** these services with precision and control.

> Mastering this skill is critical for **system admins**, **security analysts**, and **DevOps engineers**.

## ⚙️ What Are System Services?

| Feature          | Description                                          |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **Daemon**       | A background service (e.g., `sshd`, `cron`, `httpd`) |
| **Service Unit** | A configuration file for systemd-managed services    |
| **Managed by**   | `systemd`, the init system on most modern distros    |

Service files are usually found in:

- `/etc/systemd/system/`
- `/lib/systemd/system/`
- `/usr/lib/systemd/system/`

---

## 🧠 `systemd` and Unit Files

Each **service** is defined by a **unit file** with the `.service` extension.

Example: `/lib/systemd/system/sshd.service`

A service unit file may define:

- Description
- ExecStart, ExecReload, ExecStop
- Restart policy
- Dependencies

---

## 🛠️ Manage Services with `systemctl`

Here’s a breakdown of the most common service control commands:

| Command                          | Description                                     |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `systemctl start <service>`      | Start a service **immediately**                 |
| `systemctl stop <service>`       | Stop a service immediately                      |
| `systemctl restart <service>`    | Stop and start the service                      |
| `systemctl reload <service>`     | Reload config without restarting (if supported) |
| `systemctl enable <service>`     | Enable auto-start at boot                       |
| `systemctl disable <service>`    | Prevent service from starting at boot           |
| `systemctl is-enabled <service>` | Check if enabled                                |
| `systemctl status <service>`     | Show detailed status                            |
| `systemctl mask <service>`       | Prevent starting by users or other services     |
| `systemctl unmask <service>`     | Allow it to be started again                    |

## 🔐 Service States: Active, Enabled, Masked

| State        | Description                                                 |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **active**   | Currently running                                           |
| **inactive** | Not currently running                                       |
| **enabled**  | Set to start at boot                                        |
| **disabled** | Will not start at boot                                      |
| **masked**   | Blocked from being started in any way (manual or automatic) |

## 📂 Real-World Service Examples

### 1. **SSH Service**

```bash
sudo systemctl start sshd
sudo systemctl enable sshd
sudo systemctl status sshd
```

### 2. **Firewall Service**

```bash
sudo systemctl restart firewalld
sudo systemctl is-enabled firewalld
```

### 3. **Disable a Service Permanently**

```bash
sudo systemctl disable bluetooth
sudo systemctl stop bluetooth
```

### 4. **Mask a Risky Service**

```bash
sudo systemctl mask telnet.socket
```

## 🧠 Quiz Yourself

1. What’s the difference between `start` and `enable` in `systemctl`?
2. How do you check if a service is set to auto-start on boot?
3. What happens when you mask a service?
4. What is the effect of running `systemctl reload` instead of `restart`?
5. How can you see recent logs of a service?

> Bonus: Try `journalctl -u <service>`

## 📎 Summary

- Linux uses `systemd` to control system services (daemons)
- Each service is managed via a `.service` unit file
- Use `systemctl` to **start, stop, restart, enable, disable, mask**, and **query** services
- Mastering service control improves **availability**, **security**, and **boot management**

## 📋 Key Commands Recap

```bash
systemctl start <service>
systemctl stop <service>
systemctl restart <service>
systemctl enable <service>
systemctl disable <service>
systemctl mask <service>
systemctl unmask <service>
systemctl status <service>
systemctl is-enabled <service>
```
