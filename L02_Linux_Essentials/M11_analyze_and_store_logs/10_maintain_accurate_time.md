# 🧠 Linux Essentials – Module 11: Analyze and Store Logs

## Lesson 05: Maintain Accurate Time

🎯 Focus: **RHEL 8/9** | Time synchronization for logging, incident response, compliance

---

## 🎓 Introduction

Accurate system time is critical in cybersecurity and log analysis. Without synchronized clocks, it becomes impossible to:

* Reconstruct events across multiple systems
* Correlate logs during incidents
* Meet compliance requirements (e.g., PCI-DSS, HIPAA)

> 🔐 In Red Hat systems, time is maintained via **`chronyd`**, a lightweight and secure NTP client.

## 🔍 Core Concepts (Feynman + Visual)

### 🧠 Why Does Time Matter in Cybersecurity?

> **Feynman Analogy**: Imagine each system is a security guard writing in a logbook. If their watches are wrong, the entire crime timeline is messed up — you might think something happened *before* it actually did.

### 🕰️ Key Concepts

| Term          | Definition                                             |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| NTP           | Network Time Protocol – syncs time from remote servers |
| `chronyd`     | NTP client/daemon in RHEL                              |
| `timedatectl` | CLI tool to view and configure time                    |
| UTC           | Coordinated Universal Time (standard)                  |
| Drift         | Time difference between system and true time           |

---

### ⏲️ Time Files & Services (RHEL)

| File / Command          | Purpose                           |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `/etc/chrony.conf`      | Chrony configuration file         |
| `/etc/localtime`        | Current system time zone          |
| `/var/lib/chrony/drift` | Tracks clock drift                |
| `timedatectl`           | Show/set time & NTP status        |
| `chronyc`               | Chrony control tool (interactive) |

---

## 🧪 Guided Lab – Accurate Time Management in RHEL

---

### ✅ Step 1: View Current System Time and Time Zone

```bash
timedatectl
```

Output example:

```
Local time: Mon 2025-07-16 17:25:33 IST
Time zone: Asia/Kolkata (IST, +0530)
NTP enabled: yes
System clock synchronized: yes
```

---

### ✅ Step 2: Enable and Start Time Sync Service

```bash
# Check if chronyd is active
systemctl status chronyd

# Enable and start if inactive
sudo systemctl enable --now chronyd
```

---

### ✅ Step 3: Confirm NTP Synchronization

```bash
timedatectl status
```

Look for:

* `NTP service: active`
* `System clock synchronized: yes`

If not synced:

```bash
sudo timedatectl set-ntp true
```

---

### ✅ Step 4: Query NTP Sources Using `chronyc`

```bash
# Show sync sources and stats
chronyc sources

# Show tracking status
chronyc tracking
```

---

### ✅ Step 5: Configure Custom NTP Server (Optional)

Edit `/etc/chrony.conf`:

```ini
server time.cloudflare.com iburst
server in.pool.ntp.org iburst
```

Then reload Chrony:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart chronyd
```

---

### ✅ Step 6: Set System Time Manually (not recommended in production)

```bash
sudo timedatectl set-time "2025-07-16 17:45:00"
```

Use only when offline or NTP is unavailable.

## 🔴 Red Team Simulation: Tampering with Time

| Action                    | Command Example                  | Detection? |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------- | ---------- |
| Disable NTP               | `sudo timedatectl set-ntp false` | Yes        |
| Change system time        | `sudo date -s "3 days ago"`      | Yes        |
| Use time skew for stealth | Run payload before logs catch up | Maybe      |

⚠️ **Why attackers do this**:

* Evade SIEM timestamp correlation
* Hide backdoor install between boots
* Confuse forensic analysts

---

## 🔵 Blue Team Detection: Monitor Time Changes

* Use `auditd` rules for `/usr/bin/date`, `/etc/chrony.conf`
* Monitor `timedatectl` and `chronyc` usage
* Set up alert for NTP drift beyond threshold (e.g., >5 seconds)
