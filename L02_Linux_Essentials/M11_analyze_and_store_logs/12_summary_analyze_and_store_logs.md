# 📘 Summary: Analyze and Store Logs

---

## 🎯 Objective

This topic taught you how to **extract**, **analyze**, **filter**, and **securely store logs** from the system journal (`journald`). It is a foundational skill for:

* 🔐 Cybersecurity analysis
* 📊 Log correlation
* 🕵️‍♂️ Incident response
* 🧾 Audit and compliance reporting

---

## 🧰 Key Tools Used

| Tool         | Purpose                                  |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| `journalctl` | View and filter systemd-based logs       |
| `grep`       | Search patterns in logs (e.g., failures) |
| `gzip`       | Compress logs for storage                |
| `scp`        | Securely copy logs to remote machine     |

---

## 📚 Concepts Learned

### ✅ 1. View System Logs

```bash
journalctl
```

→ View all logs stored by `systemd-journald`.

---

### ✅ 2. Filter Logs by:

| Filter Type      | Example Command                   |                          |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| **Service**      | `journalctl -u ssh`               |                          |
| **Time**         | `journalctl --since "1 hour ago"` |                          |
| **Priority**     | `journalctl -p err`               |                          |
| **Text Pattern** | \`journalctl                      | grep "Failed password"\` |

---

### ✅ 3. Export Logs for Analysis

```bash
journalctl -u ssh --since yesterday > ssh_log.txt
```

➡ Save logs to a file for backup or forensic review.

---

### ✅ 4. Store Logs Securely

* 🔐 Move to USB: `cp ssh_log.txt /media/user/usb/`
* 🌐 Send to server: `scp ssh_log.txt user@server:/path/`
* 🗜 Compress: `gzip ssh_log.txt`

---

### ✅ 5. Persistent Logging

To ensure logs **survive reboots**:

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /var/log/journal
sudo systemctl restart systemd-journald
```

---

## 🧠 Why This Matters in Cybersecurity

| Function                 | Impact if Logs Are Missing            |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| Incident Investigation   | Events lost or incomplete             |
| Compliance (SOC 2, ISO)  | Audit failure                         |
| Log Correlation in SIEM  | Gaps in timeline                      |
| Insider Threat Detection | Invisibility into user/system actions |

---

## ✅ You Can Now:

* Analyze logs in real time and historically
* Filter out only relevant logs for faster triage
* Export and compress logs for case documentation
* Ensure logs are retained across reboots
