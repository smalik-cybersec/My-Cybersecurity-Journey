# 📘 Maintain Accurate Time

---

## 📌 Chapter Overview

Accurate timekeeping is a **core requirement** in cybersecurity and system administration. Whether you're investigating a breach or correlating logs across multiple servers, **incorrect system time can mislead investigations, break security protocols, or invalidate logs**.

> 🎯 **Goal:** Understand and implement time synchronization using modern Linux tools like `systemd-timesyncd`, `chrony`, or `ntpd`.

## 1️⃣ Why Accurate Time Is Critical

| Impact Area                | Risk of Inaccurate Time                |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| 🛡 Log Correlation         | Events appear out of order or missing  |
| 🔍 Forensic Investigations | Misleading timelines                   |
| 🔐 Authentication Systems  | Kerberos, TLS, and tokens may fail     |
| 📡 SIEM & SOC Operations   | Alert correlation becomes unreliable   |
| 🕒 Cron Jobs               | Scheduled tasks may run at wrong times |

> ⛔ Logs without synchronized timestamps = broken evidence chain

---

## 2️⃣ Common Time Synchronization Tools

| Tool                | Description                          | Recommended Use   |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ----------------- |
| `systemd-timesyncd` | Lightweight, default on most distros | ✅ Default choice  |
| `chrony`            | Modern, accurate, robust             | ✅ For servers/VMs |
| `ntpd`              | Classic Network Time Protocol daemon | Legacy systems    |
| `hwclock`           | Sync system time with hardware clock | Local fallback    |

---

## 3️⃣ Check System Time Configuration

### Check time status

```bash
timedatectl status
```

Sample output:

```
Local time: Sat 2025-07-12 14:00:34 IST
Universal time: Sat 2025-07-12 08:30:34 UTC
RTC time: Sat 2025-07-12 08:30:33
Time zone: Asia/Kolkata (IST, +0530)
System clock synchronized: yes
NTP service: active
```

---

## 4️⃣ Enable and Configure `systemd-timesyncd`

### Step 1: Check if service exists

```bash
systemctl status systemd-timesyncd
```

If inactive or disabled:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable --now systemd-timesyncd
```

---

### Step 2: Configure NTP servers (optional)

Edit config file:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/systemd/timesyncd.conf
```

Update this section:

```ini
[Time]
NTP=0.in.pool.ntp.org 1.in.pool.ntp.org
FallbackNTP=2.in.pool.ntp.org 3.in.pool.ntp.org
```

Then restart the service:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart systemd-timesyncd
```

---

## 5️⃣ Configure NTP Servers (Optional - Using `chrony` or `ntpd`)

If you're using **`chronyd`** instead:

```bash
sudo apt install chrony
sudo systemctl enable --now chronyd
```

Configure:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/chrony/chrony.conf
```

Then restart and check status:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart chronyd
chronyc tracking
```

---

## 6️⃣ Test Time Sync and Status

### Check if system clock is synchronized

```bash
timedatectl status
```

Look for:

```
System clock synchronized: yes
NTP service: active
```

---

### Test offset accuracy (advanced):

```bash
ntpstat
```

Or, if using `chrony`:

```bash
chronyc tracking
```

## 7️⃣ 🧪 Guided Exercise: Maintain Accurate Time

### 🎯 Exercise Goal

Ensure your Linux system's time is accurate and persists across reboots using NTP.

---

### 🧱 Environment Setup

| Requirement                     | Needed |
| ------------------------------- | ------ |
| Linux (Ubuntu/Debian preferred) | ✅      |
| `sudo` access                   | ✅      |
| Internet connection             | ✅      |

---

### ✅ Step-by-Step

#### Step 1: Verify Timezone

```bash
timedatectl
```

Set time zone (if needed):

```bash
sudo timedatectl set-timezone Asia/Kolkata
```

---

#### Step 2: Enable `systemd-timesyncd`

```bash
sudo systemctl enable --now systemd-timesyncd
```

---

#### Step 3: Add Custom NTP Servers

```bash
sudo nano /etc/systemd/timesyncd.conf
```

Add or modify:

```ini
[Time]
NTP=pool.ntp.org
FallbackNTP=ntp.ubuntu.com
```

Restart the service:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart systemd-timesyncd
```

---

#### Step 4: Verify Synchronization

```bash
timedatectl status
```

> Look for `System clock synchronized: yes`

---

#### Step 5: Reboot & Recheck

```bash
sudo reboot
```

After reboot:

```bash
timedatectl
```

✔️ Confirm time is correct and synchronized.
