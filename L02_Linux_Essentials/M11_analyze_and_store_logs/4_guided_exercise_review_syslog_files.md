# üß™ Guided Exercise ‚Äì Review Syslog Files (RHEL Focused)

> üéØ **Goal**: Gain hands-on experience with **system logs** in **RHEL**, using native tools like `rsyslog`, `logger`, and log files under `/var/log`.

---

## üß≠ Scenario

You're a **Junior SOC Analyst** at a company using **RHEL 9** systems. Your task is to:

* Understand how syslog works in RHEL
* Locate and review key system logs
* Monitor login activity and detect unauthorized attempts
* Inject and verify a test log message

---

## üß± Step-by-Step Lab Instructions

### ‚úÖ Step 1: Confirm the Logging System

üîß RHEL 7‚Äì9 uses both:

* `systemd-journald` (binary journal logs)
* `rsyslog` (writes plain text files in `/var/log`)

```bash
# Check if rsyslog is active
systemctl status rsyslog

# Check systemd journal service (always running)
systemctl status systemd-journald
```

‚û°Ô∏è Make sure `rsyslog` is active. If not:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable --now rsyslog
```

---

### ‚úÖ Step 2: Explore Key Syslog Files on RHEL

```bash
# View general system activity
sudo less /var/log/messages

# View security/authentication logs (important for SOC work)
sudo less /var/log/secure

# View cron job logs
sudo less /var/log/cron

# View kernel messages
sudo less /var/log/dmesg
```

> üí° **Note**: In **RHEL**, authentication logs go to `/var/log/secure`, not `/var/log/auth.log` (as on Debian/Ubuntu).

---

### ‚úÖ Step 3: Watch Log Files in Real Time

```bash
# Watch system messages
sudo tail -f /var/log/messages

# Watch for authentication events
sudo tail -f /var/log/secure

# Watch logs from multiple files (optional)
sudo multitail /var/log/messages /var/log/secure
```

üîç Use this live monitoring to detect brute-force or login attempts in real time.

---

### ‚úÖ Step 4: Filter Specific Log Entries

```bash
# Find all failed SSH login attempts
sudo grep "Failed password" /var/log/secure

# Find successful root logins
sudo grep "Accepted password for root" /var/log/secure

# List sudo command executions
sudo grep "sudo:" /var/log/messages
```

> üß† These are often the first indicators of privilege escalation or brute force in a RHEL server.

---

### ‚úÖ Step 5: Inject a Custom Log Entry Using `logger`

```bash
# Send a custom syslog message
logger -p user.notice "üî• TEST: Shahid reviewed syslog in RHEL."

# Confirm it appears in the log
sudo tail -n 10 /var/log/messages
```

> ‚úÖ This simulates how applications or scripts send logs to syslog.

---

### ‚úÖ Step 6: Bonus - View Binary Journals (Optional)

Although you‚Äôre focusing on traditional syslog, RHEL also stores binary logs using `journald`.

```bash
# View recent logs from journal
sudo journalctl -n 20

# Filter logs by service (e.g., SSHD)
sudo journalctl -u sshd

# View logs from previous boot
sudo journalctl -b -1
```

---

## üîê Red Team Simulation (Safe Practice)

```bash
# Malicious log deletion attempt
sudo echo "" > /var/log/secure

# Verify it's now empty (üõë Watch this in real environments)
ls -lh /var/log/secure
```

‚û°Ô∏è Now ask yourself: **Can your monitoring setup or SIEM catch this?**
Implement file integrity monitoring (`AIDE`, `auditd`, or `osquery`) for detection.

---

## üß© Reflection Questions

* What is the difference between `/var/log/messages` and `/var/log/secure` in RHEL?
* How would you script a daily check for failed SSH logins?
* What log file would you check to investigate a `cron` job failure?
