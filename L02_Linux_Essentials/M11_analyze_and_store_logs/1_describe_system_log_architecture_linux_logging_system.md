# 📘 Describe System Log Architecture (Linux Logging System)

## 📌 Chapter Overview

System logs are the **digital footprint of every critical event** on a Linux system — from user logins to kernel panics, service failures to intrusion attempts. Understanding **Linux logging architecture** empowers you to **detect attacks**, **trace errors**, and **maintain compliance**.

> 🎯 **Objective:** Learn how Linux logs are structured, where they’re stored, how they’re managed, and how tools like `rsyslog`, `journald`, and `logrotate` fit into the picture.

## 📋 What Are System Logs?

System logs are **text-based records** that document system activity and events.

These logs:

* Help detect misconfigurations and failures
* Act as forensic evidence during attacks
* Provide compliance and auditing support

---

## 🧩 Key Components of the Logging System

### 1. **Log Sources**

* Kernel
* System services (`sshd`, `cron`, `networking`)
* Applications (Apache, MySQL, NGINX)
* System users and processes

### 2. **Log Transport**

* **syslog protocol** (RFC 5424) — sends logs to a central destination
* Local logging daemons (like `rsyslog` or `systemd-journald`)

### 3. **Log Storage**

* Default location: `/var/log/`
* Organized by service or daemon

### 4. **Log Processing**

* Format conversion
* Filtering
* Forwarding to SIEM/SOC tools (Splunk, ELK, Graylog)

## 🗃️ Types of Logs

| Log Type             | File Name                    | Description                                 |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **System Log**       | `/var/log/syslog` (Debian)   | General OS messages                         |
| **Kernel Log**       | `/var/log/kern.log`          | Kernel events (e.g. driver errors)          |
| **Authentication**   | `/var/log/auth.log` (Debian) | Logins, sudo, SSH activity                  |
| **Boot Logs**        | `/var/log/boot.log`          | Boot-time events                            |
| **Cron Jobs**        | `/var/log/cron.log`          | Scheduled task activity                     |
| **Daemon Logs**      | `/var/log/daemon.log`        | System service activity                     |
| **Application Logs** | e.g., `/var/log/apache2/`    | Web server, DB server, firewall logs        |
| **Journal**          | `/run/log/journal/`          | Binary logs managed by `journald` (systemd) |
| **Custom Logs**      | `/var/log/custom.log`        | Defined by user or third-party tools        |

---

## 🛠️ Log Management Daemons

| Daemon             | Role                                     | Status   |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------- | -------- |
| `rsyslog`          | Most common syslog daemon in Linux       | Active   |
| `syslog-ng`        | Advanced syslog alternative              | Optional |
| `systemd-journald` | Default logger for systemd-based distros | Active   |

### 🔄 Workflow (Classic):

```text
[Application/Kernel]
        ↓
    syslog()/journald
        ↓
    rsyslog (filters, stores, forwards)
        ↓
   /var/log or remote SIEM/SOC
```

---

## 📁 Log File Locations

```
/var/log/
├── auth.log          → Authentication attempts
├── syslog            → General system events
├── kern.log          → Kernel messages
├── boot.log          → Boot sequence
├── cron.log          → Scheduled tasks
├── apache2/          → Apache web server logs
├── dpkg.log          → Package manager logs
└── journal/          → systemd journal (binary format)
```

---

## 🔄 Log Rotation with `logrotate`

Logs grow rapidly and can fill up disk space. `logrotate` prevents this by:

* Compressing old logs
* Rotating files weekly/daily
* Removing very old logs

### ✅ Example Config (`/etc/logrotate.d/apache2`):

```conf
/var/log/apache2/*.log {
    weekly
    rotate 4
    compress
    missingok
    notifempty
    create 640 root adm
}
```

Use command:

```bash
logrotate -d /etc/logrotate.conf   # Test config
logrotate /etc/logrotate.conf      # Run manually
```

## 🧰 Practical Log Monitoring Tools

| Tool         | Use Case                             |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| `tail -f`    | Live log monitoring                  |
| `grep`       | Pattern search in logs               |
| `journalctl` | View `systemd` journal               |
| `less`       | Paginate through large logs          |
| `awk/sed`    | Filter and extract log data          |
| `fail2ban`   | Auto-ban IPs based on log events     |
| SIEM Tools   | Advanced threat detection & alerting |

### 🔬 Lab 1: View Authentication Logs

```bash
sudo tail -f /var/log/auth.log
```

> Try a failed SSH login and watch it log in real time.

---

### 🔬 Lab 2: Use `journalctl` to View Boot Logs

```bash
journalctl -b
```

> Shows logs from the current boot session.

---

### 🔬 Lab 3: Simulate a Cron Job Entry

```bash
echo "* * * * * echo 'Hello Log' >> /var/log/custom.log" | crontab -
```

Wait a minute, then check:

```bash
tail /var/log/custom.log
```

---

### 🔬 Lab 4: Force Log Rotation

```bash
sudo logrotate -f /etc/logrotate.conf

Check `.gz` files in `/var/log/`.

---

## 🧠 Quiz & Knowledge Check

**Q1.** What is the main purpose of system logs?
→ Monitor, audit, troubleshoot, and secure system activity.

**Q2.** What log file shows failed sudo or SSH attempts?
→ `/var/log/auth.log`

**Q3.** Which command shows real-time logs?
→ `tail -f`

**Q4.** What is `logrotate` used for?
→ Automatic compression, rotation, and cleanup of old logs.

**Q5.** What’s the difference between `rsyslog` and `journald`?
→ `rsyslog` = classic syslog daemon,

---

## 🎯 Real-World Use Cases

* **Security Operations Center (SOC):**
  Detect brute force, privilege escalation, and malware via `/var/log/auth.log` or journald.

* **Digital Forensics:**
  Use `journalctl` and rotated logs to trace intrusions or insider threats.

* **Compliance:**
  PCI DSS, HIPAA, and ISO standards require **log retention, alerting, and secure access** to logs.

* **DevOps Monitoring:**
  Automate alerting for service crashes or port scan attempts from logs.
