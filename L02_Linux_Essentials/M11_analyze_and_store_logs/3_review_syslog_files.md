## Lesson 02: Review Syslog Files

---

## üéì Introduction

Syslog is the **traditional logging mechanism** used in most Unix/Linux systems to **record events**, **track system behavior**, and **audit user activity**. As a cybersecurity learner, mastering `syslog` helps you understand:

* **Which services log what**
* **How logs are stored and rotated**
* **Where to find evidence of attacks**

> üí° **Think of Syslog** as your Linux system's "black box" ‚Äî it records everything from system boots to brute-force attempts.

---

## üîç Core Concepts (Feynman + Visual)

### üß† What is Syslog?

> **Feynman Analogy**: Imagine each Linux service as a radio station sending out messages. `syslog` is the receiver that collects, sorts, and writes those messages into specific logbooks.

---

### üìÅ Default Syslog Directory

```bash
cd /var/log/
```

| File                | Description                                |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `/var/log/syslog`   | General system messages (Debian/Ubuntu)    |
| `/var/log/messages` | Generic system logs (Red Hat/CentOS)       |
| `/var/log/auth.log` | Authentication-related logs                |
| `/var/log/kern.log` | Kernel-level messages                      |
| `/var/log/boot.log` | Boot-time system logs                      |
| `/var/log/cron`     | Scheduled job (cron) logs                  |
| `/var/log/maillog`  | Mail server logs                           |
| `/var/log/dpkg.log` | Package install/update logs (Debian-based) |
| `/var/log/faillog`  | Failed login attempts                      |
| `/var/log/btmp`     | Binary log of failed logins                |

---

### üõ†Ô∏è Syslog Format

Each line typically looks like this:

```plaintext
<timestamp> <hostname> <process>[PID]: <message>
```

Example:

```bash
Jul 16 10:15:21 kali sshd[1436]: Failed password for root from 192.168.0.5 port 42135 ssh2
```

---

### üìä Facility & Severity Levels

Syslog classifies messages based on:

* **Facility** (who's logging): `auth`, `cron`, `mail`, `daemon`, etc.
* **Severity** (how bad): `emerg`, `alert`, `crit`, `err`, `warning`, `notice`, `info`, `debug`

## üß™ Labs

### üßë‚Äçüíª Beginner Lab: Read and Filter Syslog

```bash
# View latest syslog entries
tail -n 20 /var/log/syslog

# Show only auth-related messages
grep sshd /var/log/auth.log

# Show all failed login attempts
grep "Failed password" /var/log/auth.log

# Show logs by a specific date
grep "Jul 16" /var/log/syslog
```

---

### ‚öîÔ∏è Tactical Lab: Watch Syslog Live

```bash
# Real-time log watching
tail -f /var/log/syslog

# Monitor for login attempts in real-time
tail -f /var/log/auth.log | grep sshd
```

---

### üß™ Simulation Lab: Inject and Validate Syslog Entry

```bash
# Inject custom log entry using logger
logger -p user.notice "üî• Shahid Test Log Entry - Incident Simulation"

# View it in syslog
tail /var/log/syslog | grep "Shahid"
```

## üî¥ Red Team Simulation: Avoiding Syslog Detection

| Tactic           | Example                                |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Clear logs       | `echo "" > /var/log/syslog`            |
| Modify timestamp | Use `touch` or `sed` to spoof          |
| Disable logging  | `killall rsyslogd` or tamper config    |
| Fileless attacks | Run payloads in memory (no disk trace) |

‚ö†Ô∏è **Detection Risk:** High if FIM or SIEM is active.

## üîµ Blue Team Detection: Monitor & Alert on Suspicious Logs

| Log Event               | Detection Strategy                         |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Failed SSH attempts     | SIEM rule: `grep 'Failed password'`        |
| Multiple login failures | Script or `fail2ban` alerts                |
| Cleared log file        | Tripwire / AIDE / `auditd` watch           |
| Abnormal process logs   | Monitor `syslog` entries for rare services |
