# üîß Lesson 03: Linux Kernel and Architecture

## üß≠ Introduction

The **kernel** is the **core of any operating system** ‚Äî it controls everything from memory to processes to hardware. For cybersecurity and administration, knowing **how the Linux kernel works** gives you deep insight into how systems behave ‚Äî and how they can be hardened or exploited.

## üß± Core Concepts

| Term | Meaning |
|------|--------|
| **Kernel** | The core program that connects user space and hardware. It's responsible for CPU scheduling, memory management, device I/O, etc. |
| **Monolithic Kernel** | Linux uses this design ‚Äî all essential services (drivers, file system, network) run in kernel space. |
| **User Space** | Where applications and users run (e.g., bash, Firefox). Access to hardware is indirect via syscalls. |
| **System Call Interface (SCI)** | Interface allowing user space programs to request kernel services (e.g., `read()`, `execve()`). |
| **Process States** | The lifecycle of a program: Running, Sleeping, Stopped, Zombie, etc. |
| **Init System** | The first process started by the kernel (`PID 1`). Manages boot, services. (`systemd`, `SysVinit`) |

## üí° Common Kernel Responsibilities

| Area | Function |
|------|----------|
| **Process Management** | Start/stop processes, assign CPU time, manage signals |
| **Memory Management** | Allocate/deallocate RAM, manage virtual memory |
| **Device Management** | Use drivers to control hardware (keyboard, disk, NIC) |
| **File System Management** | Provide access to EXT4, XFS, etc. |
| **Network Stack** | TCP/IP, sockets, firewall (iptables/nftables) |
| **Security** | Enforce permission models, SELinux, namespaces |

## üîç Kernel in Action (Hands-on Commands)

```bash
# View running kernel version
uname -r

# List all loaded kernel modules (drivers, FS, etc.)
lsmod

# See a specific module
modinfo <module_name>

# Load/unload a kernel module (as root)
modprobe <module>
modprobe -r <module>

# See all current system processes
ps -ef

# View the first process (init system)
ps -p 1 -o comm=

# View system call activity (requires strace)
strace ls
````

üìç *Lab Tip:* Use `strace` to trace how even simple commands like `ls` talk to the kernel using system calls like `openat()`, `read()`, `write()`.

## ‚öîÔ∏è Red vs Blue Team Simulation

| Team         | Relevance                                                                                                            |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| üü• Red Team  | Exploits kernel bugs (e.g., Dirty COW, privilege escalation). Knows syscall structure to write payloads.             |
| üü¶ Blue Team | Patches kernel, audits modules, limits attack surface via kernel hardening (SELinux, AppArmor, module blacklisting). |

| PID 1 = ?             | Init system (`systemd` or `SysVinit`)         |
| `strace` = ?          | Tool to trace system calls made by programs   |

| **SOC Analyst**        | Understand how logs and syscalls reveal attacks (e.g., process spawning, file access). |
| **Penetration Tester** | Uses kernel exploits (e.g., CVEs) to escalate privileges.                              |
| **Linux SysAdmin**     | Tunes kernel parameters (`sysctl`), loads/removes modules, manages updates.            |
| **DevSecOps**          | Optimizes containers by tuning kernel namespaces and cgroups.                          |

## üßº Summary

The Linux kernel is the **engine room** of the operating system. It manages everything behind the scenes: memory, processes, networking, and hardware. Mastery of kernel architecture helps detect, defend against, and even simulate real-world attacks.
