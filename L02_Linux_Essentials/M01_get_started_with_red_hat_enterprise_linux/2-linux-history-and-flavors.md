# üìö Lesson 02: Linux History and Flavors

## üß≠ Introduction

To truly understand Linux, you must know **where it came from**, how it evolved, and why there are so many different versions (called **distributions or distros**).

This knowledge helps in choosing the right Linux flavor for:
- üîê Cybersecurity labs (e.g., Kali Linux)
- üè¢ Enterprise environments (e.g., RHEL, SUSE)
- üß™ Daily practice and scripting (e.g., Ubuntu, Fedora)

## üß± Core Concepts

| Concept | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **UNIX (1969)** | A powerful, multiuser OS developed at AT&T Bell Labs. Linux draws heavily from UNIX principles. |
| **GNU Project (1983)** | Founded by Richard Stallman to build a free UNIX-like OS. Created essential tools like `bash`, `ls`, `gcc`, etc. |
| **Linux Kernel (1991)** | Created by Linus Torvalds. He combined his kernel with GNU tools, forming the first full Linux OS. |
| **Open Source** | Linux is licensed under the **GNU GPL**, allowing users to modify and redistribute source code freely. |
| **Distribution (Distro)** | A complete OS package including the Linux kernel + GNU tools + package manager + user utilities. |
| **Upstream vs Downstream** | *Upstream* (like Fedora) is cutting-edge. *Downstream* (like RHEL) is stable and enterprise-ready. |

## üï∞Ô∏è Timeline Summary

| Year | Event |
|------|-------|
| 1969 | UNIX born at Bell Labs |
| 1983 | GNU Project launched |
| 1991 | Linux kernel v0.01 released by Linus Torvalds |
| 1993 | First Linux distros (Slackware, Debian) emerge |
| 2003 | Red Hat splits RHEL (enterprise) and Fedora (community) |
| 2010 | Linux powers Android smartphones |
| 2020+ | Linux dominates cloud, containers, servers, supercomputers |

## üß™ Hands-on Lab: Explore Your Distro Identity

Run the following commands on your system to explore its distro lineage:

```bash
# Get OS name and version
cat /etc/os-release

# Check package manager type
rpm --version       # RHEL-based
dpkg --version      # Debian-based

# Find kernel version
uname -r

# Discover architecture
arch
````

üìç Example (RHEL 9):

```bash
NAME="Red Hat Enterprise Linux"
VERSION="9.2 (Plow)"
ID="rhel"
```

üìç Example (Ubuntu):

```bash
NAME="Ubuntu"
VERSION="22.04.4 LTS (Jammy Jellyfish)"
ID=ubuntu
```

## üß≠ Popular Linux Flavors & Use Cases

| Distro                              | Type            | Use Case                                             |
| ----------------------------------- | --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL)** | Enterprise      | Servers, Datacenters, Corporate Environments         |
| **Fedora**                          | Community       | Developers, cutting-edge features, upstream for RHEL |
| **CentOS Stream**                   | Testing         | Pre-RHEL release testing                             |
| **Ubuntu**                          | Desktop/Server  | Beginner-friendly, cloud-ready, large community      |
| **Debian**                          | Stable          | Base for Ubuntu, security-critical systems           |
| **Kali Linux**                      | Security        | Penetration testing, ethical hacking                 |

| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| üü• Red Team  | Chooses **Kali** or **Parrot** for tool-rich attack platforms. Needs awareness of target OS (e.g., RHEL vs Ubuntu).  |
| üü¶ Blue Team | Hardens **RHEL**/Ubuntu servers, monitors logs, patches kernels. Picks distros based on support and update policies. |
