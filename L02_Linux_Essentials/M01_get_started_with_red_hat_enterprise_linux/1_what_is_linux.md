## 🧩 Introduction

**Linux** is a free and open-source, Unix-like operating system kernel first released in 1991 by **Linus Torvalds**. It serves as the **backbone of modern computing** — powering everything from smartphones to supercomputers, servers, firewalls, IoT devices, and cloud platforms.

> “Linux is not just an OS; it’s a movement of open, secure, and collaborative computing.”

## 🕰️ A Brief History of Linux

| Year   | Milestone                                                        |
| ------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1969   | UNIX developed by AT\&T Bell Labs                                |
| 1983   | Richard Stallman starts GNU Project                              |
| 1991   | Linus Torvalds creates the Linux kernel                          |
| 1992   | Linux and GNU merge, forming full OS                             |
| 2000s+ | Major Linux distributions emerge (Red Hat, Ubuntu, Debian, etc.) |

## 🎛️ Components of a Linux System

| Component           | Role                                               |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **Kernel**          | The core engine managing hardware and system calls |
| **Shell**           | Interface between user and kernel (e.g., Bash)     |
| **File System**     | Organized hierarchical directory structure         |
| **User Space**      | Applications and commands users interact with      |
| **Daemons**         | Background services like cron, sshd, httpd         |
| **X Window System** | Optional graphical interface                       |

## 📦 Linux Distributions (Distros)

> A distribution = Linux kernel + GNU utilities + package manager + tools

| Distro             | Audience                    | Features                       |
| ------------------ | --------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| **Red Hat (RHEL)** | Enterprises & security pros | Stable, certified, secure      |
| **Ubuntu**         | Beginners, developers       | User-friendly, desktop-ready   |
| **Debian**         | Developers, servers         | Stability, free software       |
| **Kali Linux**     | Penetration testers         | Built-in ethical hacking tools |
| **Arch Linux**     | Advanced users              | Rolling release, customizable  |
| **CentOS Stream**  | Dev/Test for RHEL           | Red Hat’s upstream development |

## 📍 Why Linux is Essential in Cybersecurity

* 🧠 **Most security tools are Linux-native** (Nmap, Wireshark, Metasploit, Burp Suite)
* 🔐 **Servers and firewalls run Linux** (Apache, Nginx, IPTables)
* 🐧 **Kali Linux**, **Parrot OS**, and **BackBox** are Linux-based
* 💥 Linux allows deep-level system interaction for pentesting
* 📂 Log auditing, user monitoring, and network tracing are simpler

> Learning Linux is **non-negotiable** for aspiring security professionals.

## 🧪 Lab Activities

> *Use a Red Hat-compatible VM or Ubuntu/Kali if RHEL is not available.*

1. ✅ Install a Linux OS (RHEL, CentOS, Ubuntu, Kali) in VirtualBox
2. 🗂️ Explore directory structure: `ls`, `pwd`, `cd`, `tree`
3. 👤 Create a new user: `sudo useradd shahid && sudo passwd shahid`
4. 📜 Explore system logs: `sudo less /var/log/syslog` or `journalctl -xe`
5. 📦 View running processes: `ps aux`, `top`, `htop`
