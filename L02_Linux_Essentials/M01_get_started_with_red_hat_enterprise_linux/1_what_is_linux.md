## 🧩 Introduction

**Linux** is a free and open-source, Unix-like operating system kernel first released in 1991 by **Linus Torvalds**. It’s the backbone of modern computing, powering everything from smartphones to supercomputers, cloud servers, IoT devices, and more.

> "Linux is not just an OS; it’s a movement of open, secure, and collaborative computing."

## 📍 Why Linux is Essential in Cybersecurity

- 🧠 Most security tools are Linux-native (Nmap, Wireshark, Metasploit, Burp Suite)
- 🔐 Servers and firewalls often run Linux (Apache, Nginx, IPTables)
- 🐧 Specialized security distros: Kali Linux, Parrot OS, BackBox
- 💥 Enables deep system interaction for penetration testing
- 📂 Simplifies log auditing, user monitoring, and network tracing

> **Learning Linux is non-negotiable for aspiring security professionals.**

## 🧪 Lab Activities

> _Use a Red Hat-compatible VM, or Ubuntu/Kali if RHEL isn’t available._

1. **Install a Linux OS** (RHEL, CentOS, Ubuntu, Kali) in VirtualBox
2. **Explore directory structure:**  
   `ls`, `pwd`, `cd`, `tree`
3. **Create a new user:**  
   `sudo useradd shahid && sudo passwd shahid`
4. **Explore system logs:**  
   `sudo less /var/log/syslog` or `journalctl -xe`
5. **View running processes:**  
   `ps aux`, `top`, `htop`
