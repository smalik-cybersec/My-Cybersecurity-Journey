Here is a detailed explanation of **User and Group Concepts** in Linux, as described in your Red Hat RH124 course (section 6, page 154), along with a quiz to test your understanding.

## **Describe User and Group Concepts**

### **What is a User?**

A **user** is an identity recognized by the Linux system, representing a person or a service that can log in, run processes, and own files. Each user has a unique **username** and a numeric **user ID (UID)**. User information is stored in `/etc/passwd`[^1].

### **What is a Group?**

A **group** is a collection of users. Groups allow you to assign the same permissions to multiple users at once. Each group has a unique **group name** and a numeric **group ID (GID)**. Group information is stored in `/etc/group`[^1].

### **Why Use Users and Groups?**

- **Security:** Isolate users and restrict access to files and commands.
- **Collaboration:** Allow multiple users to share access to files and directories by assigning them to the same group.
- **System Administration:** Manage permissions and policies efficiently.


### **Types of Users**

- **Regular users:** Created for people who use the system.
- **System users:** Created for services or system processes (often with no login shell).
- **Root user:** The superuser with UID 0, has unrestricted system access[^1].


### **Primary and Supplementary Groups**

- **Primary group:** Assigned when the user is created; files created by the user are associated with this group by default.
- **Supplementary groups:** Additional groups a user can belong to, allowing access to more resources.


### **User and Group Files**

- `/etc/passwd`: User account information
- `/etc/shadow`: Encrypted user passwords
- `/etc/group`: Group information


## **Quiz: Describe User and Group Concepts**

**1. Where is user account information stored?**
*Answer:* `/etc/passwd`

**2. What is the difference between a primary group and a supplementary group?**
*Answer:* The primary group is the default group for a user; supplementary groups are additional groups the user belongs to.

**3. What is the UID of the root user?**
*Answer:* 0

**4. How can groups be used to simplify file permission management?**
*Answer:* By assigning users to a group and setting file permissions for the group, you can allow multiple users to access or modify files without managing permissions for each user individually.

**5. What file contains group information?**
*Answer:* `/etc/group`

Guided Exercise: Manage Local User Accounts ..

Here’s a detailed explanation and practical steps for **managing local user accounts** in Linux, based on the Red Hat RH124 Student Guide (see section: Manage Local User Accounts, page 171).

## **Manage Local User Accounts**

### **Key Concepts**

- **User accounts** allow individuals to log in, run processes, and own files.
- **Local user accounts** are stored on the system in `/etc/passwd` (account info), `/etc/shadow` (passwords), and `/etc/group` (group membership).


## **Common Commands for User Management**

| Command | Purpose | Example |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| `useradd` | Create a new user account | `sudo useradd alice` |
| `userdel` | Delete a user account | `sudo userdel alice` |
| `usermod` | Modify user account properties | `sudo usermod -aG wheel alice` |
| `passwd` | Set or change a user’s password | `sudo passwd alice` |
| `id` | Display user and group IDs | `id alice` |
| `getent passwd` | Show all user accounts | `getent passwd` |

## **Guided Exercise: Manage Local User Accounts**

### **1. Create a New User**

```bash
sudo useradd -m bob
```

- `-m`: Create a home directory for the user.


### **2. Set the User’s Password**

```bash
sudo passwd bob
```

- You’ll be prompted to enter and confirm the password.


### **3. Verify User Creation**

```bash
getent passwd bob
```

- This will show the entry for `bob` if the account was created successfully.


### **4. Modify User Account**

- **Add user to a group (e.g., wheel for admin rights):**

```bash
sudo usermod -aG wheel bob
```

- **Change the username:**

```bash
sudo usermod -l robert bob
```


### **5. Delete a User Account**

```bash
sudo userdel -r bob
```

- `-r`: Remove the user’s home directory and mail spool.


### **6. View User Information**

```bash
id bob
```

- Shows UID, GID, and group memberships.


## **Best Practices**

- Always set a strong password for new accounts.
- Remove unused accounts to reduce security risks.
- Use groups to manage permissions efficiently.
