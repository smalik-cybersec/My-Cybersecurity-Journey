## 🧠 Lesson Summary

The **“Access the Command Line”** lesson introduces the foundational skill of working with the **Linux shell** — primarily using **Bash (Bourne Again Shell)** — to control and manage a Linux system through text-based commands.

This module is essential for **system administration**, **automation**, and **cybersecurity operations**, where deep system access and fast command execution are required.

## 📌 Key Takeaways

| Concept                                | Description                                                                                              |   |     |
| -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | - | --- |
| 🧑‍💻 **CLI (Command Line Interface)** | A text-based environment used to interact with the Linux OS                                              |   |     |
| 💡 **Why Use CLI**                     | Faster, more powerful, flexible, automation-ready, and required for server-side or remote work           |   |     |
| 📦 **Access Methods**                  | Terminal emulator in desktop GUI, TTY consoles, SSH remote login                                         |   |     |
| 🔧 **Bash Shell**                      | The most commonly used shell in Linux, used for executing commands and scripts                           |   |     |
| 🛠️ **Common Commands**                | `pwd`, `ls`, `cd`, `echo`, `man`, `whoami`, `mkdir`, `touch`, etc.                                       |   |     |
| 🔀 **Command Structure**               | `command [options] [arguments]` — standard format for all Linux tools                                    |   |     |
| 🔗 **Command Features**                | Supports variables, redirection (`>`, `>>`), command substitution (`$(command)`), and chaining (`&&`, \` |   | \`) |

## 🎯 Why This Matters in Cybersecurity

* **Most cybersecurity tools** (Nmap, Nikto, Metasploit, etc.) require CLI proficiency
* **Headless servers** and remote machines are accessed through the terminal
* **Incident response**, **log analysis**, and **system hardening** often happen via CLI
* Writing **scripts** for automation, scanning, monitoring is only possible with shell access
* Tools like **SSH**, **iptables**, **tcpdump**, and **auditd** are CLI-driven

---

## ✅ What You Should Be Able to Do Now

* Confidently open and navigate the **terminal** from a Linux GUI
* Understand and use **basic Bash commands**
* Use **shell variables**, **command substitution**, and **output redirection**
* Recognize the **structure and execution flow** of a Linux command
* Begin applying these skills in labs, scripting, and tool use
