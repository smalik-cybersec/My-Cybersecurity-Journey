## üîß How SSH Works

SSH creates a **secure, encrypted tunnel** between client and server.

### üîê SSH Handshake Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
Client->>Server: Connects to port 22
Server-->>Client: Sends public key
Client->>Server: Negotiates encryption (Diffie-Hellman)
Client->>Server: Authenticates (password/key)
Server-->>Client: Session established (encrypted)
```

## üß± SSH Protocol Stack

| Layer                | Role                                                    |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Transport Layer      | Encryption, integrity, compression                      |
| Authentication       | Validates identity (password/key/cert)                  |
| Connection Layer     | Manages multiple sessions in one SSH connection         |

## üõ°Ô∏è SSH in Cybersecurity

- üõ†Ô∏è Remote server administration
- üìÅ Secure file transfer (`scp`, `sftp`)
- üïµÔ∏è Penetration testing (pivoting/tunneling)
- üîÅ Automated scripts for backup/monitoring
- üöß VPN tunneling / port forwarding

---

## üíª Basic SSH Commands

#### SSH Login

```bash
ssh username@remote_IP_or_hostname
```
Example:
```bash
ssh shahid@192.168.1.100
```

#### Specify a Different Port

```bash
ssh -p 2222 username@host
```

#### Run a Remote Command

```bash
ssh shahid@192.168.1.100 "uptime"
```

#### Transfer Files using SCP

```bash
scp file.txt shahid@192.168.1.100:/home/shahid/
```

---

## üîê SSH Key-Based Authentication

#### Generate SSH Key Pair

```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
```
- Public Key: `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`
- Private Key: `~/.ssh/id_rsa`

#### Copy Public Key to Remote

```bash
ssh-copy-id shahid@192.168.1.100
```
Now login **without password**:
```bash
ssh shahid@192.168.1.100
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è SSH Configuration Files

| File                     | Purpose                                |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`   | Server-side SSH settings               |
| `~/.ssh/config`          | Client-side custom profiles            |
| `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` | Allowed public keys for login          |

Example `~/.ssh/config`:
```ini
Host webserver
    HostName 192.168.1.100
    User shahid
    Port 22
```
Connect with:
```bash
ssh webserver
```

## üõ° Hardening SSH (Best Practices)

| Setting / Action                  | Reason                                    |
| --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Disable root login                | Prevent direct root compromise            |
| Use key-based authentication only | Prevent brute-force password attacks      |
| Change default port               | Reduce automatic bot scans                |
| AllowUsers/AllowGroups            | Restrict login to specific accounts       |
| Enable firewall rules             | Control access to SSH port                |
| Disable SSH Protocol 1            | Use only Protocol 2 (secure)              |
| Enable 2FA (where supported)      | Adds additional security layer            |
| Use strong key types (ed25519)    | Modern cryptography                       |

## üß© Troubleshooting SSH

| Problem                       | Fix                                                       |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| üî¥ `Connection refused`       | SSH server down / wrong port                              |
| üî¥ `Permission denied`        | Username, password, or key permissions                    |
| üîí Stuck at authentication    | Check `~/.ssh`/`authorized_keys` permissions              |
| üß± Firewall blocks SSH        | Review `ufw`, `iptables`, or cloud firewall rules         |
| ‚õî SSH login disabled for user | Check `AllowUsers` in `sshd_config`                       |
| üõë "Man-in-the-middle" warning| Key mismatch: verify server fingerprint, clear `known_hosts` |
| ‚ùì Debugging                   | Use `ssh -v user@host` for verbose output                |
