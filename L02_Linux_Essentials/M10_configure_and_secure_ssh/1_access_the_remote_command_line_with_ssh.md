## 🔧 How SSH Works

SSH establishes a **secure, encrypted tunnel** between two machines: the **client** and the **server**.

### 🔐 Simplified SSH Handshake Flow

1. **Client initiates connection** to SSH server (typically on port 22).
2. **Server sends public key** to client.
3. **Client and server agree** on encryption (Diffie-Hellman key exchange).
4. **Client authenticates** (password or key-based).
5. **Encrypted session established.**

## 🧱 SSH Protocol Stack

| Layer                | Role                                                    |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Transport Layer**  | Provides encryption, integrity, and compression         |
| **Authentication**   | Validates user identity (password/key/cert)             |
| **Connection Layer** | Manages multiple logical sessions in one SSH connection |

---

## 🛡️ Use Cases in Cybersecurity

* 🛠 **Remote server administration**
* 📁 **Secure file transfer** (with `scp`, `sftp`)
* 🧪 **Penetration testing**: pivoting, tunneling, remote shell access
* 🔁 **Automated scripts** for backup, monitoring, patching
* 🚧 **VPN tunneling / Port forwarding**

---

## 💻 Basic SSH Commands

### 🔹 SSH Login

```bash
ssh username@remote_IP_or_hostname
```

Example:

```bash
ssh shahid@192.168.1.100
```

### 🔹 Specify a Different Port

```bash
ssh -p 2222 shahid@192.168.1.100
```

### 🔹 Run a Remote Command

```bash
ssh shahid@192.168.1.100 "uptime"
```

### 🔹 Transfer Files using SCP

```bash
scp file.txt shahid@192.168.1.100:/home/shahid/
```

---

## 🔐 SSH Key-Based Authentication

### 🔸 Generate SSH Key Pair

```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
```

* Stores:

  * Public Key: `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`
  * Private Key: `~/.ssh/id_rsa`

### 🔸 Copy Public Key to Remote Machine

```bash
ssh-copy-id shahid@192.168.1.100
```

Now login **without password** using:

```bash
ssh shahid@192.168.1.100
```

## ⚙️ SSH Configuration Files

| File                     | Purpose                                |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`   | Server-side SSH settings               |
| `~/.ssh/config`          | Client-side custom profiles            |
| `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` | List of public keys allowed to connect |

Example client config (`~/.ssh/config`):

```ini
Host webserver
    HostName 192.168.1.100
    User shahid
    Port 22
```

Then connect simply using:

```bash
ssh webserver
```

## 🛡 Hardening SSH (Security Best Practices)

| Setting / Action                     | Benefit                                 |
| ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| Disable root login                   | Prevent direct root compromise          |
| Use key-based auth only              | Prevent brute-force password attacks    |
| Change default port (22)             | Reduce bot scanning                     |
| Enable `AllowUsers`/`AllowGroups`    | Restrict login to specific users/groups |
| Enable firewall rules (UFW/iptables) | Control access to port 22               |
| Disable SSH Protocol 1               | Use only Protocol 2 (more secure)       |

## 🧩 Common Issues and Troubleshooting

| Problem                       | Fix                                                       |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🔴 `Connection refused`       | SSH server not running or wrong port                      |
| 🔴 `Permission denied`        | Wrong username, password, or key permissions              |
| 🔒 Stuck at authentication    | Check file permissions of `~/.ssh` and `authorized_keys`  |
| 🧱 Firewall blocking SSH      | Check `ufw`, `iptables`, or cloud provider firewall rules |
| ⛔ SSH login disabled for user | Check `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` for `AllowUsers` directive   |
