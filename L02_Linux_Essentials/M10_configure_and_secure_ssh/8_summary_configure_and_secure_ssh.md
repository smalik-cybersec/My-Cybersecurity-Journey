# ✅ Summary: Configure and Secure SSH

## 📌 What You Learned

You now understand how to **configure, secure, and manage SSH access** on Linux systems using OpenSSH. This includes both foundational skills and security best practices used by system administrators, cloud engineers, and cybersecurity professionals.

## 🔐 Key Concepts Covered

### 🔑 SSH Key-Based Authentication

* Uses **asymmetric cryptography** (public/private key pair).
* Prevents password guessing and brute-force attacks.
* Ideal for **automated and secure login**.

### ⚙️ sshd\_config Customization

Located at `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`, it controls how the SSH server behaves.

| Setting                  | Purpose                                  | Example             |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| `Port`                   | Changes default SSH port                 | `Port 2222`         |
| `PermitRootLogin`        | Blocks root user from logging in         | `no`                |
| `PasswordAuthentication` | Disables password login                  | `no`                |
| `AllowUsers`             | Whitelist specific SSH users             | `AllowUsers shahid` |
| `ClientAliveInterval`    | Ping client to keep session alive        | `60`                |
| `LoginGraceTime`         | Timeout for login prompt                 | `30`                |
| `Banner`                 | Displays warning/legal text before login | `/etc/issue.net`    |

## 🔐 Security Best Practices Applied

✅ Enforced **key-only login**
✅ Disabled **root login**
✅ Changed **default port (22)** to custom (e.g., 2222)
✅ Enabled **user whitelisting**
✅ Configured **custom login banners**
✅ Set **timeout policies** to kill idle connections
✅ Verified syntax with `sshd -t`
✅ Restarted SSH service and tested changes safely

## 🧪 Practical Labs Completed

* SSH Key Pair Generation (`ssh-keygen`)
* Key Deployment with `ssh-copy-id` or manual method
* File permission fixes on `~/.ssh/` and `authorized_keys`
* Full SSH daemon hardening (`sshd_config`)
* Banner creation and legal compliance setup
* Log monitoring (`/var/log/auth.log`)

## 🚀 Real-World Applications

* Used by **system administrators** to manage production servers
* Standard practice in **DevSecOps and cloud infrastructure** (AWS, Azure, GCP)
* Required for **penetration testers** and **Red Team** persistence methods
* Essential in **compliance** (PCI DSS, ISO 27001) to enforce strong access policies
