## 📘 **Module Overview: Managed Networking (Module 12)**

This module equips learners with the **core and advanced competencies** needed to **analyze, configure, validate, and secure Linux network interfaces and naming systems** using both **command-line tools** and **configuration files**. You will simulate **enterprise-level tasks** such as managing IP addressing, DNS resolution, hostname integrity, and detecting tampering through Red/Blue Team logic.

## 🧪 **Lab Architecture Summary**

✅ **Lab:** `Module12-AllInOne-Lab.md`
📁 Location: `labs/module12/`

**Real-world scenario:** Configure a Linux server on RHEL from scratch, setting static networking, domain-based hostname, validating all configs, and simulating Red/Blue Team behavior.

### 🔬 Phases:

1. **Baseline Mapping**: Identify NICs, IPs, gateway, DNS.
2. **Static Configuration**: Set IP, subnet, gateway, DNS via `nmcli` and config files.
3. **Hostname + Name Resolution**: Persistent hostname and DNS resolution setup.
4. **Hardening**: Manual config file editing (`ifcfg-*`, `resolv.conf`).
5. **Red Team**: Hostname spoofing + DNS poisoning.
6. **Blue Team**: Detect via `journalctl`, validate `/etc/hosts`, system logs.

## ⚔️ Red/Blue Team Simulation

### 🔴 Red Team (Attacker)

* Spoofed hostname using `hostnamectl`
* DNS redirection via `/etc/hosts` manipulation (simulated phishing, MITM)

### 🔵 Blue Team (Defender)

* Detected tampering using:

  * `journalctl -u systemd-hostnamed`
  * `grep` in `/etc/hosts`
  * DNS behavior mismatch analysis

> **Mapped to ATT\&CK Techniques:**
>
> * T1070.006 (Indicator Removal from Hostname)
> * T1565.001 (Hosts File Manipulation)

## 💬 Impress with This Summary By Saying:

> “In Module 12, I configured and validated full Linux networking manually and via tools like `nmcli`, detected DNS poisoning, and enforced hostname integrity. I simulated attacker scenarios, analyzed logs, and restored trust—all using RHEL systems. This shows I can both **secure and break Linux networks** confidently.”
