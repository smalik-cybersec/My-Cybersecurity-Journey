# Module 12: Conditional Statements

## Lesson 08: Shorthand If-Else (Ternary Operator)

### 1. Purpose of the Shorthand If-Else
The shorthand `if-else` statement, also known as the **ternary operator** or **conditional expression**, provides a concise way to write simple `if-else` logic on a single line.
