# Module 13: Looping - While Loop

## Concept
A `while` loop in Python is used to repeatedly execute a block of code as long as a specified condition evaluates to `True`. The loop continues to iterate until the condition becomes `False`.

## Syntax
```python
while condition:
    # Code block to be executed
    # Ensure a statement exists to eventually make 'condition' False
