# Module 13: Looping - For Loop Introduction

## Concept
A `for` loop in Python is used for iterating over a sequence (such as a list, tuple, string, dictionary, or set) or any other iterable object. It executes a block of code once for each item in the sequence, making it ideal for tasks where the number of iterations is determined by the size of the collection being processed.

## Syntax
```python
for item in sequence:
    # Code block to be executed for each 'item'
    # (must be indented)
