### 1. Definition & Core Concept
> Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its readability and versatility.

Python was conceived in the late 1980s by Guido van Rossum at the Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in the Netherlands. Its development began as a successor to the ABC language, aiming to create a language that was easy to read, simple to use, and highly extensible. The name "Python" was chosen by van Rossum as a tribute to the British comedy group Monty Python, reflecting his desire for the language to be enjoyable to work with. The first version was released in 1991. Python 2.0 followed in 2000, and the significantly revised, backward-incompatible Python 3.0 was released in 2008, which is now the industry standard.

### 2. Why It Matters (The Cybersecurity Context)
* **Relevance:** Understanding the design philosophy behind Python helps in appreciating its strengths, which directly translate into its effectiveness for cybersecurity tasks. Its focus on readability and rapid development makes it ideal for scripting quick solutions and complex tools.
* **Use-Case 1:** Knowing Python's evolution (e.g., Python 2 vs. Python 3) is crucial when dealing with legacy security tools or scripts. Many older penetration testing tools might be written in Python 2, requiring knowledge of its nuances or migration strategies.
* **Use-Case 2:** Python's origins as a general-purpose language highlight its flexibility, allowing cybersecurity professionals to use it for a wide array of tasks, from network scanning to forensic analysis, rather than being confined to a specialized security language.

### 3. Syntax & Practical Implementation
#### Annotated Example:
```python
# No specific Python code to demonstrate for 'History' concept itself,
# as this lesson is purely theoretical.
# However, understanding the history informs future choices, such as:

# Choosing Python 3 for new projects due to its modern features,
# better performance, and active community support.
