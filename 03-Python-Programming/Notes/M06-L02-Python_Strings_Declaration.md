# M06-L02 | Strings: Declaration

### 1. Definition & Core Concept
> String declaration refers to the various ways of defining and creating string literals in Python, using single, double, or triple quotes, along with special handling for escape sequences and raw strings.

Python provides flexible ways to declare strings to accommodate different scenarios, including handling quotes within strings and multi-line text. Understanding these methods is essential for correctly representing textual data.

### 2. Why It Matters (The Cybersecurity Context)
* **Relevance:** Correct string declaration is vital for accurately representing data. In cybersecurity, you'll encounter various text formats, including file paths, command-line arguments, network payloads, and configuration details, many of which contain special characters or need to span multiple lines. Incorrect declaration can lead to syntax errors, misinterpretation of data, or security vulnerabilities (e.g., command injection flaws if input is not handled properly).
* **Use-Case 1:** **File Path Manipulation:** When working with file system operations (e.g., malware analysis, forensic investigations, log collection), you often need to define file paths. Raw strings (`r"C:\Users\Admin\document.doc"`) are invaluable here to avoid issues with backslashes being interpreted as escape sequences, ensuring the path is read literally.
* **Use-Case 2:** **Crafting Network Payloads/Commands:** When building tools to interact with network services or execute commands (e.g., generating HTTP requests, crafting shell commands for remote execution), you might need to embed quotes or special characters (`\n`, `\t`) within your strings. Proper use of double/single quotes and escape sequences ensures the payload is correctly formed and interpreted by the target system.

### 3. Syntax & Practical Implementation
#### Annotated Example:
```python
# 1. Using Single Quotes (')
# Best for simple strings, or when the string contains double quotes.
single_quoted_string = 'This is a string using single quotes.'
print(f"Single Quoted: {single_quoted_string}")

# Example where single quotes are convenient
quote_in_string_1 = 'He said, "Hello there!"'
print(f"Quote in string (single outer): {quote_in_string_1}")

# 2. Using Double Quotes (")
# Best for simple strings, or when the string contains single quotes (apostrophes).
double_quoted_string = "This is a string using double quotes."
print(f"Double Quoted: {double_quoted_string}")

# Example where double quotes are convenient
quote_in_string_2 = "It's a beautiful day, isn't it?"
print(f"Quote in string (double outer): {quote_in_string_2}")

# 3. Using Triple Quotes (''' ''' or """ """)
# Ideal for multi-line strings and docstrings.
multi_line_string_example = """This string
can span
multiple lines
without using \\n."""
print(f"\nMulti-line String:\n{multi_line_string_example}")

# Example of a docstring for a function
def calculate_hash(data):
    """
    Calculates the SHA256 hash of the input data.
    This is a multi-line docstring explaining the function's purpose.
    Args:
        data (str): The input string to hash.
    Returns:
        str: The SHA256 hash in hexadecimal format.
    """
    # In a real scenario, you'd use hashlib for hashing
    return f"Hash of '{data}': [placeholder_hash]"

print(f"\nDocstring Example:\n{calculate_hash.__doc__}")

# 4. Escape Sequences
# Used to include special characters that would otherwise be problematic.
escaped_quotes = 'He screamed, "Run! It\'s coming!"'
print(f"\nEscaped Quotes: {escaped_quotes}")

new_line_tab = "Line 1\n\tLine 2 with a tab."
print(f"New Line and Tab:\n{new_line_tab}")

# 5. Raw Strings (r or R prefix)
# Treat backslashes as literal characters, useful for file paths and regex.
windows_path_normal = "C:\\Program Files\\My Application\\file.exe"
print(f"\nNormal Path: {windows_path_normal}")

windows_path_raw = r"C:\Program Files\My Application\file.exe"
print(f"Raw Path: {windows_path_raw}")

# Example with a regex pattern (concept, not executable regex code)
# Match 'word.word' where '.' is literal
regex_pattern_normal = "word\\.word"
regex_pattern_raw = r"word\.word"
print(f"Regex Normal (needs escape): {regex_pattern_normal}")
print(f"Regex Raw (no escape needed for literal dot): {regex_pattern_raw}")
