# Module 12: Conditional Statements

## Lesson 02: If Statement Introduction

### 1. Purpose of the `if` Statement
The `if` statement is the most basic conditional control flow statement in Python. It allows a program to execute a specific block of code **only if** a given condition evaluates to `True`. If the condition is `False`, the indented code block associated with the `if` statement is skipped entirely.

### 2. Syntax
The general syntax for an `if` statement is:

```python
if condition:
    # This code block is executed if 'condition' is True
    # Note the mandatory indentation (typically 4 spaces)
    statement_1
    statement_2
    # ...
# Code execution continues here after the if block (regardless of condition)
