### 1. Definition & Core Concept
> Python was created by Guido van Rossum with the core motivations of enhancing readability, boosting developer productivity, and providing a highly extensible and enjoyable programming experience.

Guido van Rossum aimed to develop a language that was easy to read and write, significantly reducing the cognitive load on programmers compared to existing languages like C++. This focus on simplicity and clear syntax became a defining characteristic of Python. He also sought to create a "glue language" that could seamlessly integrate with components written in other languages, such as C, allowing for flexibility and performance where needed. Furthermore, Python was designed to be open-source from its inception, fostering a collaborative community and a vast ecosystem of libraries.

### 2. Why It Matters (The Cybersecurity Context)
* **Relevance:** Python's design principles directly align with the needs of cybersecurity professionals. Its readability and rapid development capabilities are invaluable for quickly prototyping security tools, analyzing data, and automating routine tasks.
* **Use-Case 1:** The ease of scripting allows security analysts to quickly write custom parsers for log files, develop small proof-of-concept exploits, or create incident response scripts on the fly, without getting bogged down in complex syntax.
* **Use-Case 2:** Python's extensibility means that cybersecurity tools written in other languages (e.g., C for performance-critical network operations) can be easily wrapped and controlled by Python, allowing for powerful hybrid solutions in areas like network intrusion detection systems or malware analysis.

### 3. Syntax & Practical Implementation
#### Annotated Example:
```python
# No specific Python code to demonstrate for the 'Why Created' concept itself,
# as this lesson focuses on the design philosophy.
# However, the direct result of this philosophy is code like this:

# Clear, readable code that minimizes boilerplate:
def greet_user(name):
    """
    A simple function demonstrating Python's readability.
    This is easy to understand, reflecting Guido's design goals.
    """
    return f"Hello, {name}! Welcome to Python for Cybersecurity."

message = greet_user("CyberSec Student")
print(message)

# The simplicity allows for rapid prototyping, e.g., quickly checking a port:
import socket
s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
try:
    s.connect(("google.com", 80))
    print("Port 80 is open on google.com")
except socket.error as e:
    print(f"Could not connect: {e}")
finally:
    s.close()
