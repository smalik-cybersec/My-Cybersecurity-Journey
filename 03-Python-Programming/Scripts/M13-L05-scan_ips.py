# Description: This script demonstrates how to iterate through a list of IP addresses
# using a 'for' loop, simulating a basic network scan.
# In a real-world scenario, actual network scanning tools or libraries
# would be integrated here.

# Define a list of IP addresses to "scan"
ip_addresses = ["192.168.1.1", "192.168.1.10", "192.168.1.254", "10.0.0.1"]

print("Starting IP scan simulation...")

# Iterate over each IP address in the list
for ip in ip_addresses:
    # Print a message indicating the current IP being processed
    print(f"Simulating scan for IP: {ip}")
    # Placeholder for actual network scanning logic (e.g., using 'socket' or 'nmap' library)
    # For example:
    # try:
    #     # Attempt to connect to a common port (e.g., 80 for HTTP)
    #     s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
    #     s.settimeout(1) # Set a timeout for the connection attempt
    #     result = s.connect_ex((ip, 80))
    #     if result == 0:
    #         print(f"  Port 80 is open on {ip}")
    #     s.close()
    # except Exception as e:
    #     print(f"  Error scanning {ip}: {e}")

print("IP scan simulation finished.")
