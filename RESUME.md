*This section details hands-on projects completed during my diploma. All projects are documented and available on my GitHub.*

#### Project 1: Python-Based Network Scanner
*   **Module:** 03 - Python Programming | **Status:** In Progress
*   **Description:** Developed a command-line tool using Python's socket library to perform basic port scanning on target IP addresses. This project demonstrates fundamental knowledge of network protocols and scripting for reconnaissance.
*   **Skills Demonstrated:** Python Scripting, Socket Programming, TCP/IP.
*   **Link:** [Link to the specific script in your 03-Python-Programming/Scripts/ folder]

#### Python Set Operations for Cybersecurity
* Module: 03 - Python Programming (Module 11: Set)
* Description: Developed a comprehensive script demonstrating Python set declaration, mutation methods (`add`, `remove`, `discard`, `pop`, `clear`), mathematical set operations (`union`, `intersection`, `difference`, `symmetric_difference`), comparison methods (`issubset`, `issuperset`, `isdisjoint`), and in-place updates. Applied these concepts to simulate cybersecurity tasks such as managing blacklists, combining threat intelligence feeds, and comparing security scan findings.
* Skills Demonstrated: Python Sets, Data De-duplication, Threat Intelligence Processing, Log Analysis, Vulnerability Data Comparison, Scripting for Security Automation.
