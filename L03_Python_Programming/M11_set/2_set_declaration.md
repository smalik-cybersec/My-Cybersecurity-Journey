For "Module 11: Set - Lesson 02: Declaration", the sources provide comprehensive details on how to declare sets in Python.

Here's an overview of set declaration:

*   **Set Definition and Characteristics**
    *   A set is a **collection of items** in Python [conversation history].
    *   Sets are typically **wrapped in curly braces `{}`** [conversation history, 107]. It's worth noting that if you encounter curly braces without key-value pairs, you are likely looking at a set, which distinguishes them from dictionaries that also use braces [conversation history, 107].
    *   Unlike lists and dictionaries, **sets do not retain items in any specific order** [conversation history, 107].

*   **Literal Syntax for Set Creation**
    *   You can declare sets directly using **literal syntax**, such as `{1, 2}` or `{1, 2, 3}`. This method involves enclosing elements separated by commas within curly braces.
    *   For example, you can build a set directly like this: `{'python', 'ruby', 'python', 'c'}`. Python will then display it without duplicates and in no specific order, such as `{'ruby', 'python', 'c'}`.
    *   Literal set syntax like `{1, 2, 3}` is **both faster and more readable** than using the `set()` constructor [conversation history, 262]. This is because Python uses a specialised `BUILD_SET` bytecode for literal creation, which is more efficient than looking up the constructor, building a list, and then passing it to the constructor.

*   **Declaring an Empty Set**
    *   There is **no literal notation for an empty set** [conversation history, 261].
    *   To create an **empty set, you must use the constructor `set()`** [conversation history, 261]. Using `{}` (empty curly braces) will create an empty dictionary, not an empty set [conversation history, 261].

*   **Using the Constructor for Sets**
    *   Although literal syntax is generally preferred for its speed and readability, you can also declare a set by calling the `set()` constructor, for example, `set()`. This approach is slower due to the additional steps Python needs to perform, such as looking up the constructor and building an intermediate list.

*   **Declaring `frozenset` Objects**
    *   For `frozenset` objects, which are the immutable counterparts to `set`, there is **no literal syntax** [conversation history, 264].
    *   They **must be created by calling their constructor**, for example, `frozenset(range(10))` [conversation history, 264]. The standard string representation of a `frozenset` in Python 3 will also look like a constructor call.

*   **Set Comprehensions**
    *   Set comprehensions (often referred to as "setcomps") were introduced in Python 2.7 [conversation history, 265]. They offer a concise way to build sets, similar to list comprehensions [conversation history, 265]. This allows for efficient creation of sets based on existing iterables and conditions, such as `{chr(i) for i in range(32, 256) if 'SIGN' in name(chr(i), '')}`.

After declaration, subsequent lessons in the curriculum will delve into the various functions and operations available for sets [conversation history].
