Module 07 of a Python programming curriculum, titled "Operators," begins with an **introduction to operators**.

This module covers various types of operators, including:
*   **Arithmetic operators**
*   **Assignment operators**
*   **Comparison operators**
*   **Logical operators**
*   **Identity operator**
*   **Bitwise operator**
*   **Membership operator**

In Python, operators are symbols that perform operations on values and expressions. For example, `2 + 2` is an expression where `+` is an operator and `2` is a value. Expressions always evaluate down to a single value. Different data types exist, and every value belongs to one data type, such as integers (whole numbers) or floating-point numbers (numbers with a decimal point).

The standard library includes a module named `operator` that provides function equivalents for many arithmetic operators, which can be useful in functional programming contexts to avoid writing trivial anonymous functions.
