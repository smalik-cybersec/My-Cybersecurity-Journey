Module 07, Lesson 02 focuses on **Arithmetic Operators** in Python. These operators are fundamental symbols that perform mathematical computations on values and expressions. Python supports these operations on various numerical data types, including **integers** (whole numbers) and **floating-point numbers** (numbers with a decimal point).

Here are the core arithmetic operators discussed:

*   **Addition (`+`)**: This operator sums two operands. For example, `2 + 3` evaluates to `5`. Beyond numbers, `+` is also used for **string concatenation** and **list concatenation**. When used with `datetime` or `timedelta` objects, `+` can add `timedelta` objects to `datetime` objects or other `timedelta` objects.
*   **Subtraction (`-`)**: This operator subtracts the right operand from the left. For instance, `5 - 2` evaluates to `3`. It can also subtract `timedelta` objects.
*   **Multiplication (`*`)**: This operator multiplies two operands. For example, `2 * 3` evaluates to `6`. Similar to addition, `*` is also used for **string and list replication** (repeating a string or list multiple times). `timedelta` objects can be multiplied by integer or float values using `*`.
*   **Division (`/`)**: This operator divides the left operand by the right. In Python 3, the result of division, even between two integers, will **always be a float**. For example, `3 / 2` evaluates to `1.5`, and `4 / 2` evaluates to `2.0`. `timedelta` objects can also be divided by numerical values using `/`.
*   **Exponent (`**`)**: This operator raises the left operand to the power of the right operand. For example, `3 ** 2` evaluates to `9`, and `10 ** 6` evaluates to `1000000`.
*   **Modulo (`%`)**: This operator returns the **remainder** of a division operation. For instance, `22 % 8` evaluates to `6`. This operator is useful for determining if a number is a multiple of another. It's also mentioned in the context of string formatting.
*   **Integer Division / Floored Quotient (`//`)**: This operator performs division and returns only the **integer part** of the quotient, effectively rounding down (flooring) the result. For example, `23 // 7` evaluates to `3`.
*   **Matrix Multiplication (`@`)**: Introduced in Python 3.5, this operator is specifically designed for matrix multiplication.

**Important Concepts and Behaviors:**

*   **Order of Operations (Precedence)**: Python adheres to standard mathematical order of operations. Exponents (`**`) are evaluated first. Multiplication (`*`), division (`/`), integer division (`//`), and modulo (`%`) are evaluated next, from left to right. Addition (`+`) and subtraction (`-`) are evaluated last, also from left to right.
*   **Parentheses `()`**: You can use parentheses to **override the default order of operations**, ensuring that expressions are evaluated in the sequence you specify. For example, `(2 + 3) * 4` evaluates to `20`, illustrating how parentheses change precedence from `2 + 3 * 4` which evaluates to `14`.
*   **Type Coercion**: When an operation combines an integer and a float, Python's default behavior is to **return a float**. For example, `1 + 2.0` results in `3.0`.
*   **Whitespace**: While Python does not require specific spacing between operators and values, using a single space is a common **convention for improving code readability**.
*   **String and Bytes Compatibility**: It is crucial to remember that `bytes` and `str` instances **cannot be used together with operators** like `+` and `%`.
*   **Operator Overloading**: Python allows user-defined classes to implement special methods (often called "dunder methods" due to their `__name__` format, e.g., `__add__` for `+`) to enable instances of these classes to respond to operators. When implementing these methods, the general rule is to **return a new object** as the result of the operation, rather than modifying the original operands. If an operation cannot be handled (e.g., due to incompatible types), returning `NotImplemented` allows Python to try a "reversed" operator method (like `__radd__`) on the other operand. However, Python has limitations: you cannot overload operators for built-in types, nor can you create new operators; you can only overload existing ones.
*   **Augmented Assignment Operators**: Python provides shorthand operators for common operations where the result is assigned back to the left operand. Examples include `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, and `%=`. For instance, `spam += 1` is a concise way of writing `spam = spam + 1`. For mutable objects, special in-place methods (e.g., `__iadd__`) can be implemented to directly modify the object.

The `operator` module in Python's standard library provides **function equivalents** for many arithmetic operators. This is particularly useful in functional programming contexts where you might want to use an operator as a function without defining a small, anonymous (lambda) function. For example, `operator.mul` can be used with `functools.reduce` to calculate factorials.
