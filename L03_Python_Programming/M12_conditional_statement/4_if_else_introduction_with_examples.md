Building on Lesson 02, which introduced the `if` statement, and Lesson 03's practice questions, Module 12, Lesson 04 delves into the **`if-else` statement**. This is a fundamental control flow structure in Python that allows your program to make a binary decision: execute one block of code if a condition is true, or execute a different block if the condition is false.

### Purpose of `if-else` Statements
Often, you will encounter situations where you need your program to take one action when a specific condition is met and a **different action in all other cases**. The `if-else` statement is designed for precisely these scenarios. It ensures that one of two possible actions will **always be executed**.

### Structure of an `if-else` Statement
An `if-else` block is similar to a simple `if` statement but adds an alternative path. It consists of:
1.  The **`if` keyword**.
2.  A **conditional test** (an expression that evaluates to `True` or `False`).
3.  A **colon (`:`)** marking the end of the `if` line.
4.  An **indented block of code** (the `if` clause), which contains instructions to be executed if the condition is `True`.
5.  The **`else` keyword**, placed on a new line and unindented to match the `if` statement.
6.  A **colon (`:`)** after the `else` keyword.
7.  Another **indented block of code** (the `else` clause), which contains instructions to be executed if the initial `if` condition evaluates to `False`. Unlike the `if` or `elif` statement, an `else` statement **does not have a condition**.

The visual indentation is crucial in Python, as it defines the blocks of code.

### Execution Flow
When Python encounters an `if-else` statement:
1.  It first **evaluates the `conditional_test`** associated with the `if` statement.
2.  If the test evaluates to **`True`**, the **indented code block following the `if` statement is executed**. After this block finishes, Python skips the `else` block and continues with the rest of the program.
3.  If the test evaluates to **`False`**, Python **ignores the `if` block** and proceeds directly to the **`else` block**, executing the code within it.

In an `if-else` structure, **one of the two actions will always be executed**.

### Examples

Here are some examples demonstrating the `if-else` statement:

*   **Voting Eligibility Check**:
    ```python
    age = 17 #

    if age >= 18: # Conditional test: Is age greater than or equal to 18?
        print("You are old enough to vote!") #
        print("Have you registered to vote yet?") #
    else: #
        print("Sorry, you are too young to vote.") #
        print("Please register to vote as soon as you turn 18!") #
    ```
    In this scenario, since `age` is 17, the condition `age >= 18` evaluates to `False`. Consequently, the `if` block is skipped, and the code within the `else` block is executed, printing the message for those too young to vote.

*   **Handling Special Items in a List**:
    This example, mentioned in Lesson 02 practice, effectively uses an `if-else` structure within a loop:
    ```python
    cars = ['audi', 'bmw', 'subaru', 'toyota'] #

    for car in cars: #
        if car == 'bmw': # If the current car is 'bmw'
            print(car.upper()) # Print it in uppercase
        else: # Otherwise
            print(car.title()) # Print it in title case
    ```
    This loop iterates through the `cars` list. For each `car`, it checks if its value is `'bmw'` using the `if` test. If `True`, it prints the car name in uppercase; if `False`, the `else` block is executed, and the car name is printed in title case.

*   **Checking for Non-Anchovies**:
    ```python
    requested_topping = 'mushrooms' #

    if requested_topping != 'anchovies': # Compares values using the inequality operator
        print("Hold the anchovies!") #
    else:
        print("Adding anchovies to your pizza.")
    ```
    Since `'mushrooms'` is not equal to `'anchovies'`, the condition `requested_topping != 'anchovies'` evaluates to `True`, and the message "Hold the anchovies!" is printed. If `requested_topping` were `'anchovies'`, the `else` block would execute.

### Styling `if-else` Statements
For improved readability, Python's PEP 8 style guide recommends using a **single space around comparison operators** like `==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, and `>=`. For example, `if age >= 18:` is preferred over `if age>=18:`. This spacing does not alter Python's interpretation of the code but makes it easier for humans to read.

The `if-else` structure provides a powerful way to implement decision-making logic, ensuring that your program responds appropriately to different conditions. This sets the stage for more complex decision chains, such as the `if-elif-else` structure, which handles more than two possible situations.
