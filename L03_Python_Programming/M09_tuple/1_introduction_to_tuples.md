Lesson 01 of Module 09 is dedicated to the **Introduction to Tuples**. Tuples are an essential data type in Python, often considered a "cousin" to lists.

Here is an introduction to tuples:

*   **Definition and Syntax**
    *   A tuple is a sequence data type that can contain **multiple values**.
    *   Unlike lists, which use square brackets (`[]`), tuples are indicated by **parentheses (`()`)**. For example, `(1, 2, 3)` is a tuple.
    *   Tuples, along with lists and strings, are classified as **sequence data types** in Python.

*   **Key Characteristic: Immutability**
    *   A fundamental difference between tuples and lists is that tuples are **immutable**. This means that **once a tuple is defined, you cannot change its elements**. You cannot add, remove, or modify individual items within an existing tuple after its creation.
    *   However, it's important to understand the nuance: while the tuple itself cannot be changed (i.e., its elements cannot be reassigned), if a tuple contains **mutable objects** (such as lists), the *contents* of those mutable objects *can* still be altered. This can lead to a surprising trait where the "value" of a tuple might appear to change if it holds references to mutable objects, even though the tuple's direct immutability remains.

*   **Common Use Cases**
    *   Tuples are frequently used for **multiple assignment**. This allows you to assign values to several variables in a single line, for instance, `areaCode, mainNumber = mo.groups()` where `mo.groups()` returns a tuple. This technique can shorten programs and enhance readability.
    *   They are also used to initialize sequences, and can be constructed efficiently using **generator expressions** which are enclosed in parentheses.
    *   Tuples are suitable for situations where you want to ensure data remains constant and unchangeable throughout the program, providing data integrity.

Following this introduction, Lesson 03 of Module 09 would typically cover all tuple methods and functions with examples.
