In Python, **Lesson 02** delves into the rules and conventions governing **variable declaration**. Understanding these rules is crucial for writing code that is both functional and readable. Variables in Python are best understood not as "boxes" containing data, but rather as **"labels that you can assign to values"** or "sticky notes" pointing to data. This process of associating a name with an object is called "name binding".

Here are the key rules and conventions for declaring variables in Python:

**Rules for Valid Variable Names:**

*   **Allowed Characters**: Variable names **can contain only letters, numbers, and underscores (`_`)**.
*   **Starting Character**: A variable name **must start with a letter or an underscore (`_`)**, but **cannot start with a number**. For example, `message_1` is valid, but `1_message` is not.
*   **No Spaces**: Variable names **cannot contain spaces**. To separate words in a variable name, **underscores (`_`) should be used** (e.g., `greeting_message` is valid, but `greeting message` will cause errors).
*   **Avoid Keywords**: You **must not use Python's reserved keywords or built-in function names** as variable names. Keywords like `print`, `def`, `if`, `True`, `False`, `None`, `for`, `while`, `class`, `import`, etc., have specific programmatic purposes. Attempting to use them will result in errors.
*   **Case-Sensitivity**: Python variable names are **case-sensitive**. This means `spam`, `SPAM`, `Spam`, and `sPaM` are considered four distinct variables.

**Conventions for Good Variable Names (PEP 8 Guidelines):**

Beyond the strict rules that prevent errors, Python programmers follow conventions to enhance code readability, often outlined in PEP 8.

*   **Descriptive and Concise**: Variable names should be **short but descriptive**, clearly indicating the data they hold. For instance, `student_name` is preferred over `s_n`.
*   **Lowercase with Underscores**: By convention, **functions, variables, and attributes** are typically written in `lowercase_underscore` format.
*   **Constants**: For variables whose values are intended to remain **unchanged throughout the program's execution (constants)**, the convention is to use **all capital letters with underscores** (e.g., `MAX_CONNECTIONS = 5000`).
*   **Classes**: Class names should follow **`CapitalizedWord` (CamelCase)** format.
*   **Protected and Private Attributes**:
    *   **Protected instance attributes** typically start with a **single leading underscore** (e.g., `_leading_underscore`). This is a convention indicating internal use but doesn't strictly prevent access.
    *   **Private instance attributes** use a **double leading underscore** (e.g., `__double_leading_underscore`). This invokes a name mangling mechanism to reduce the chance of accidental overwriting in subclasses, though it doesn't make the attribute truly private.
*   **Caution with Ambiguous Characters**: Be mindful when using the lowercase letter `l` and the uppercase letter `O`, as they can be easily confused with the numbers `1` and `0` respectively.

**Implications of Rules and Dynamic Typing:**

*   **Errors**: Violating these naming rules will lead to errors, such as a `NameError` if you try to use a variable name that hasn't been defined or is misspelled.
*   **Dynamic Typing**: Even with these naming rules, Python remains a **dynamically typed language** [previous conversation, 531]. This means that **variables do not have a fixed type and can be reassigned to values of different data types** or classes during the program's execution [previous conversation, 531]. For example, a variable assigned a string value can later be reassigned an integer value [previous conversation, 531]. This behavior is a direct consequence of variables being labels that can be detached from one object and reattached to another [previous conversation, 126, 346].
